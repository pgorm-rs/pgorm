//! pgorm links one prqlc: the fork its own manifest names, at one revision.
//!
//! The root crate depends on the necessary-nu fork of prqlc through a git
//! dependency, and a dependency travels with pgorm into every crate that
//! depends on it — the crates here that declare their own `[workspace]`
//! (`pgorm-python`, so that Python configuration stays out of ordinary Rust
//! builds ([spec:pgorm:req:python.optional]), and the campaign's bridge,
//! replay harness, sqlmap adapter and standalone reproducers, so that their
//! dependencies stay out of an ordinary pgorm build), the compile-suite
//! crates the campaign generates at run time, and downstream consumers.
//!
//! The fork used to be applied by a `[patch.crates-io]` table instead, and
//! cargo reads a patch from the root of the workspace being built and nowhere
//! else. Every detached workspace therefore had to repeat the table, and one
//! that did not silently linked stock prqlc and compiled different SQL from
//! the one every pgorm test exercises. That hid three fork commits from every
//! campaign run of 2026-09-15; it then turned out eight more detached
//! workspaces had never repeated the table, under a version of this file that
//! listed the two it knew about; and finally the compile suite's generated
//! crates, which no committed manifest describes, linked stock prqlc on every
//! run. Each fix covered the instances it could see. Making the fork the
//! dependency removes the class: nothing has to be repeated, so nothing can be
//! forgotten.
//!
//! These tests hold the invariant from both ends. The root declares the fork
//! at a full commit, every other declaration names the same one, and nothing
//! in the checkout patches prqlc — a patch would be a second source of truth,
//! and the one that reaches some builds and not others. And every lockfile in
//! the checkout that resolves prqlc resolves it from the fork at that
//! revision, which is what a `--locked` build reads. The generated compile
//! crates are held to the same thing by the campaign's own suite
//! (`security/generative/tests/test_compile_lockfile.py`), because they exist
//! only while the campaign runs.
//!
//! No database: every check reads version-controlled files.
