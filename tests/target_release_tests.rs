//! Which PostgreSQL release a build targets, and how the `pg-19` feature
//! travels between the crates that carry it.
//!
//! PostgreSQL 18 is the floor and the default, so no feature names it; `pg-19`
//! targets 19 (`sql.target` in docs/spec/sql-ast.md). The typed surface is
//! pgorm-query's, so the feature is declared there and forwarded by the crates
//! a build turns it on through. A forwarding edge that went missing would
//! leave pgorm built for 19 over a pgorm-query built for 18, and nothing else
//! would notice until a 19-only item failed to resolve.
//!
//! No database: the checks read the build's own constant and the manifests.
