//! pgorm links one prqlc and one pg_query: the forks its own manifest names,
//! each at one revision.
//!
//! The root crate depends on two forks through git dependencies — the
//! necessary-nu fork of prqlc, which compiles `pgorm::pipeline` and `prql!`,
//! and the necessary-nu fork of pg_query.rs, which carries PostgreSQL 18's
//! grammar ahead of upstream's release — and a dependency travels with pgorm
//! into every crate that depends on it: the crates here that declare their own
//! `[workspace]` (`pgorm-python`, so that Python configuration stays out of
//! ordinary Rust builds ([spec:pgorm:req:python.optional]), and the campaign's
//! bridge, codegen runner, replay harness, sqlmap adapter and standalone
//! reproducers, so that their dependencies stay out of an ordinary pgorm
//! build), the compile-suite crates the campaign generates at run time, and
//! downstream consumers.
//!
//! The prqlc fork used to be applied by a `[patch.crates-io]` table instead,
//! and cargo reads a patch from the root of the workspace being built and
//! nowhere else. Every detached workspace therefore had to repeat the table,
//! and one that did not silently linked stock prqlc and compiled different SQL
//! from the one every pgorm test exercises. That hid three fork commits from
//! every campaign run of 2026-09-15; it then turned out eight more detached
//! workspaces had never repeated the table, under a version of this file that
//! listed the two it knew about; and finally the compile suite's generated
//! crates, which no committed manifest describes, linked stock prqlc on every
//! run. Each fix covered the instances it could see. Making the fork the
//! dependency removes the class: nothing has to be repeated, so nothing can be
//! forgotten. The pg_query fork was adopted the same way from the start, and is
//! held here by the same checks, because a detached workspace resolving stock
//! pg_query would parse with PostgreSQL 17's grammar while every pgorm test
//! parses with 18's.
//!
//! These tests hold the invariant from both ends, for each fork. The root
//! declares the fork at a full commit, every other declaration names the same
//! one, and nothing in the checkout patches it — a patch would be a second
//! source of truth, and the one that reaches some builds and not others. And
//! every lockfile in the checkout that resolves the fork's crates resolves them
//! from the fork at that revision, which is what a `--locked` build reads. The
//! generated compile crates are held to the same thing by the campaign's own
//! suite (`security/generative/tests/test_compile_lockfile.py`), because they
//! exist only while the campaign runs.
//!
//! No database: every check reads version-controlled files.
