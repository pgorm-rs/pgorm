"""Codegen inputs: DDL and writer options, judged by whether the output builds.

`pgorm-codegen` is checked elsewhere against golden token text, which answers
whether the generator still emits what it used to emit and nothing about
whether a compiler accepts it. These cases feed its real output to rustc.

Two refusals live on this surface and must not be confused. Options the writer
cannot read and DDL the bridge does not carry are refused by the *generator*,
before any source exists; everything it does emit is then the compiler's to
judge. A suite that scored a generator refusal as a compile rejection would
report a type system holding a line that was never reached.
