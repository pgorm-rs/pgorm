"""Assemble initial acceptance out of separately identified evidence.

Five things are gathered here and none of them is folded into another: the
runtime campaign report, Python/Rust replay parity, the bounded compile suite,
the named regressions that closed resolved discoveries, and the stress
demonstration. Each keeps the vocabulary it was produced with, so a reader can
tell a constructor call from a compile invocation from an oracle decision.

Acceptance is not the union of things that passed. A component that did not run
is recorded as not run, an obligation still outstanding is recorded as
outstanding, and every open finding is listed by name. The report fails when a
required component is missing, which is what stops absence from reading as
success.
