"""Drive `pgorm-codegen` out of process, and keep its refusals separable.

The generator is Rust, so Python reaches it through a small binary that reports
per case. Three outcomes come back and they mean three different things:

    generated       — source exists; the compiler is next to judge it
    generator-error — pgorm-codegen refused at its own boundary
    driver-error    — the harness handed it something it could not read

Only the first two are evidence about pgorm. The third is a harness fault and
is raised, never scored: a suite that quietly counted its own bugs as library
behaviour would report exactly the coverage it failed to obtain.
