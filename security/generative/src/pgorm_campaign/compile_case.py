"""The unit the compile suite generates: one bounded Rust program and its verdict.

Compile coverage answers a different question from runtime coverage, so it is
modelled separately all the way down. A runtime program is judged by what
PostgreSQL returned; a compile case is judged by what rustc *refused*, and a
refusal only counts when the compiler names the rejection the case predicted.

# source rejection in a single crate still reported all sixteen, so typeck and
# borrowck cases demonstrably coexist. Resolution is the one that bites — an
# unresolved import swallows everything the module would otherwise have said —
