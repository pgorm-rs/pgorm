"""Borrows and brands: the contracts whose whole content is a compile refusal.

A transaction exists only inside the closure `transaction` runs, and its
`DatabaseTransaction` borrows the connection exclusively; `Binder` brands the
expressions it mints with a lifetime the pipeline invents per call. Neither
contract can be observed at runtime: a program that violates one never exists
as a binary, and a program that respects one is indistinguishable from a
program that had no such contract. The evidence is the rejection itself.
