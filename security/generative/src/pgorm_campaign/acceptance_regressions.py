"""Run the named regressions, and show each one failing without its fix.

A regression test that passes proves nothing on its own: a test asserting the
defect's behaviour would also pass. What makes it a regression is that removing
the fix makes it fail, so each entry here is run twice — once in this checkout,
and once in a throwaway worktree with the fix taken back out.

The counterfactual worktree is scratch. It is created under the build output,
never in the source tree, and it is removed whether or not the experiment
worked. Nothing here edits the checkout it was launched from.
