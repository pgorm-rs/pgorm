"""Build each batch and read per-case verdicts out of the compiler's own report.

Two failures wear the same exit status as a rejection and must not be scored as
one. A *toolchain* failure — an unresolvable lock, a missing dependency, a
linker that fell over — produces no diagnostic attributable to any case, and a
suite that read it as "the negatives were rejected" would report its strongest
result on the run where it learned nothing. An *unattributed* diagnostic is the
same problem one level down: something was rejected, but not demonstrably the
program that predicted it.

So attribution is positive and per case. A negative passes only when a
diagnostic inside its own line range names the rejection it predicted; silence
is never a pass.
