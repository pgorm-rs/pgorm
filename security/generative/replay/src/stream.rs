//! Draining a row stream the way the campaign's `effects.stream` drains one.
//!
//! A streamed step is not "the rows, eventually": it is a bounded prefix plus
//! what the stream's own lifecycle then reports. `comparison.streamed` checks
//! both — the prefix against the reference multiset, and the terminal
//! `(complete, cancelled, closed)` triple against what the declared `take` and
//! `cancel` permit. So the drain has to be as deliberate as the binding's.
