## Rationale

The strongest error handling is the error that cannot occur. Rust's
type system can carry most of pgorm's protocol rules — a query that
must have a projection, a condition holder that is chain-style or
condition-style but never both, an insert whose models share one
column set — and where it does, misuse dies at compile time instead
of in production.

This ranks the failure-handling ladder explicitly: first make the
invalid state unrepresentable; where that is impractical, return a
typed error per [dec:pgorm:no-panic]; a panic on caller input is
never the design. The crate already contains the pattern done well —
`ActiveValue`'s three-state enum, `TryInsert` as a distinct type
rather than a flag — and inherited runtime-checked seams are
converted toward it deliberately, area by area, not by blanket
rewrite.
