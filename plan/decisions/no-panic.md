## Rationale

pgorm is a library: its callers own the process, and a caller's
recoverable mistake — an unset primary key, an emptied select list, a
misassembled statement — must come back to them as a value they can
handle, not as an unwound stack. `DbErr` exists precisely to be that
channel, and every execution-adjacent path already returns
`Result<_, DbErr>`.

Panics remain legitimate for exactly one thing: internal invariant
violations, where continuing would be incoherent and the bug is
pgorm's own. The distinction is who made the mistake — the caller's
mistakes are typed errors; pgorm's own bugs may panic.

The inherited SeaORM surface predates this rule and still panics in
documented places. Those panics are spec-pinned as current behaviour
and are not silently rewritten; they are converted deliberately,
node by node, with their rules bumped, whenever a touched area brings
one into reach. New code, and any changed behaviour, follows the ban
from the start.
