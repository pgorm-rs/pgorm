# Python pipelines

`pgorm.pipeline` composes the real Rust `pgorm::pipeline::Pipeline`. The native
module owns each pipeline and compiles it through pgorm's PRQL compiler. Queries
execute directly against PostgreSQL; no HTTP server is involved.

```python
import pgorm as p
from pgorm import pipeline as pl

items = p.Table("items", schema="app")
amount = pl.col("items", "amount")
category = pl.col("items", "category")
total = pl.alias("total")

query = (
    pl.from_(items)
    .filter(amount > 10)
    .group(category)
    .aggregate(pl.sum(amount).as_(total))
    .sort(total.desc())
    .take(5)
)

async with p.Pool(dsn) as pool:
    async with pool.connection() as connection:
        records = await query.all(connection)
```

`from_` and `source` accept a native `Table`, registered `Entity`, another
`Pipeline`, named `Source`, or runtime `Model` descriptor. Models contribute their
table metadata. `pl.col(table_alias, physical_column_name)` creates a qualified
reference; it does not translate a runtime model's logical field names. Use
`pl.source(model)` when passing a model to `join`, `append`, `intersect` or `remove`.

`pl.col(table_alias, entity.col(name))` reads a registered entity's column under
`table_alias` — the entity's table, or the name a source was read by — and compares
it as the entity's own column does: a column whose domain is over an enum is cast
to the enum in every comparison, `in_array`, `coalesce`, `min` and `max`, because
PostgreSQL has no operator for the domain itself (`42883`). A column named by text
carries no type. Where a column of that kind has no registration — a `Table`, an
alias naming a projection — `expr.compares_as(p.TypeName(name, schema=...))` names
the enum it compares as:

```python
lines = pl.col("lines", "mood").compares_as(p.TypeName("mood"))
query = pl.from_(p.Table("lines")).filter(lines == "glad")
assert query.inspect().sql == "SELECT * FROM lines WHERE CAST(mood AS mood) = $1"
```

Every stage returns a new pipeline. `filter`, `derive`, `select`, `group`,
`aggregate`, `window`, `sort` and `join` have `*_with` counterparts. Projection,
grouping and ordering methods accept positional expressions; their callbacks
return an expression, list or tuple. A stage that binds takes zero through 32
expressions; a stage that binds nothing has no such limit. `group` requires a
following `aggregate` before further pipeline stages.

## Literals and parameters

A plain operand — a `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `dict` or `p.Value` —
is a parameter: the stage that takes it binds it through its own binder, inferred
as any parameter is, so plain Python integers infer `i64` and an explicit
`p.Value(value, kind)` keeps its Rust value variant. `None` has no kind to bind;
write `pl.literal(None)` (or `pl.null()`), `is_null()`, or bind
`p.Value.null(kind)`. Only `pl.literal(value)` writes a value into the SQL text:
`None`, a `bool`, an integer within `bigint`, a finite `float` or a `str`, plain
or as a `p.Value` of that kind.

```python
bound = pl.from_(items).filter(amount > p.Value(10, "i32"))
assert bound.inspect().sql.endswith("WHERE amount > $1")
assert bound.inspect().params[0].kind == "i32"
written = pl.from_(items).filter(amount > pl.literal(10))
assert written.inspect().params == []
```

A synchronous `*_with` callback receives the stage's binder, whose
`binder.bind(value)` mints one placeholder to reuse within the stage:

```python
query = pl.from_(items).filter_with(
    lambda binder: (amount > binder.bind(10)) & (amount < binder.bind(10) + 90)
)
```

A callback runs once during construction. Each binding is minted once inside the
corresponding Rust binder scope, and a plain operand the callback returns is bound
after them. Reusing the expression reuses its placeholder; the Rust compiler prunes
unused bindings and rebases composed pipelines' values. Saving a binder or bound
expression does not extend its lifetime: operations on it after the callback raise
`LifecycleError`. Expressions from different binder callbacks cannot be combined,
and a bound expression cannot enter an `Over` or a plain stage. An `Over`'s
partition and ordering take no value at all, bound or plain: write a column or a
`pl.literal`.

Qualified enum and enum-array `Value` tags are refused as pipeline operands with
`ConstructionError`: Rust's pipeline binds a value bare and has no cast for a
value of a named type. A plain string can use PostgreSQL type inference when that
is intended; compared with a column that compares as an enum, it is inferred as
that enum. The SQL builder expression API (`p.Expr`) and pipeline expression API
(`pl.PipelineExpr`) are separate native types.

## Joins, windows and sets

Name a relation with `pl.source(relation).named(alias)`. The alias becomes its
column qualifier. `join(source, predicate, kind=p.Join.Left)` supports inner,
left, right and full joins. `pl.this(column)` and `pl.that(column)` identify sides
inside join predicates when an embedded pipeline has no explicit name.

```python
rank = pl.alias("row_rank")
top_two = (
    pl.from_(items)
    .window(
        pl.row_number().as_(rank),
        over=pl.over().by(category).sort_by(amount.desc()).rows(None, 0),
    )
    .filter(rank <= 2)
)
```

Windows support `by`, `sort_by`, `rows(start, end)` and `range(start, end)`; `None`
means unbounded. Aggregate functions include `sum`, `min`, `max`, `average`,
`stddev`, `count`, `count_distinct` and `count_rows`. Window functions include
`row_number`, `rank`, `rank_dense`, `first`, `last`, `lag(offset, value)` and
`lead(offset, value)`.

`append`, `intersect` and `remove` consume another source; use matching explicit
projections on both sides. Rust's compiler rejects unsupported wildcard shapes.
`distinct`, `take(count)` and inclusive `take_range(start, end)` use native stage
semantics. Compiler errors, including reserved alias names, surface as
`ConstructionError`. So does Rust's identifier screen, when the pipeline is
compiled: a name containing a double quote or NUL, a name beginning with `$`,
and the name `*` are refused rather than quoted, whatever stage introduced them.
A `$` after the first character is an ordinary name character.

## Results and registered models

`all(connection)` returns dynamic `Record` objects. `one(connection)` and
`optional(connection)` append native `take(1)`; the former errors when no row exists,
and the latter returns `None`. `inspect(terminal="one")` shows that exact SQL.
Pool and connection `query`, `one` and `optional` also accept pipelines and keep
their strict dynamic-record cardinality rules. Use `pool.stream(query)` or
`connection.stream(query)` for bounded asynchronous record streaming.

An application native module can register a concrete Rust entity tuple:

```rust
registry.entity::<account::Entity>("app.Account")?;
registry.entity::<note::Entity>("app.Note")?;
registry.sources::<(account::Entity, note::Entity)>("app.AccountNotes")?;
```

Python then selects actual Rust models through `SelectedSources`:

```python
accounts = p.entity("app.Account")
notes = p.entity("app.Note")
query = (
    pl.from_(accounts)
    .join(
        pl.source(notes).named("n"),
        pl.col("accounts", "id") == pl.col("n", "account_id"),
        kind=p.Join.Left,
    )
    .select_sources(
        pl.sources("app.AccountNotes"), qualifiers=["accounts", "n"]
    )
)
rows = await query.all(connection)
```

One to six source types are supported. Every returned row is a tuple, and every
position is optional, including the first under right/full joins. For a single
source, `(None,)` means a result row whose source was absent; `None` from
`optional` means no result row. Present rows use the real registered Rust model
decoder, so malformed present data raises `DecodeError`. The Rust terminal
rejects prior stages that remove source namespaces, such as explicit projection
or aggregation. Registered source selections expose `all`, `one`, `optional` and
`inspect`, the terminals running on a pool, a connection or a transaction; model
streaming is not exposed.

`p.capabilities()` records the exact pipeline vocabulary, limits and compiled
source registrations. A stock wheel contains no application entity registrations.

## Verification

`tests/test_pipeline.py` executes the installed public API against PostgreSQL.
`cargo test --manifest-path pgorm-python/Cargo.toml --test pipeline` compares 21
Python programs with independent Rust constructions, including exact SQL and
`Values`. `checks/entities.py` builds and installs an independent application wheel
and verifies all six source tuple arities, optional model decoding, aliases,
right/full joins, errors and cancellation, alongside entity and graph regressions.
