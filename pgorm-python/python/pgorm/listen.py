    Iterate it with ``async for`` to receive ``Notification`` objects in the
    order PostgreSQL sent them; ``listen`` and ``unlisten`` may run while a

    At most ``capacity`` notifications wait unread. One more closes the
    listener, and iteration raises ``ConnectionError`` after yielding those
    waiting. A failed or terminated connection raises its error the same way.
    Nothing reconnects: a notification sent while nothing listened is lost,
