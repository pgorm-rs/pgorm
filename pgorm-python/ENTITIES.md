# Compiled application entities

`pgorm.entity(name)` exposes a concrete Rust entity compiled into the installed
native module. Queries own a real `pgorm::Select<E>`; records own `E::Model`;
writes call `E::ActiveModel` and its `ActiveModelBehavior` hooks. All calls run
inside Python's process, using PostgreSQL's native protocol.

The standalone wheel has an empty registry. Runtime `Table`, SELECT and CRUD
builders work without registrations. Applications that already have Rust
entities can build a wheel containing those types and the common Python API.
Python cannot create Rust generic instantiations at runtime.

## Build an application wheel

Use one native module containing both the common bindings and the application
registrations. Disable the binding crate's default `standalone-module` feature
and provide the following initializer in the application's Rust crate:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pymodule(gil_used = true)]
fn _native(module: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
    let mut registry = pgorm_python::entities::Registry::default();
    registry.entity::<my_entities::account::Entity>("app.Account")?;
    pgorm_python::install(module, registry)
}
```

The library target is named `_native` with `crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]`.
Depend on this checkout's `pgorm-python` with `default-features = false`, the
same checkout's `pgorm`, your entity crate, and `pyo3 = "=0.29.2"`. Define an
`extension-module` feature enabling `pyo3/extension-module`. Registration
requires `E: EntityTrait + Send + Sync + 'static`,
`E::Model: IntoActiveModel<E::ActiveModel> + Sync + 'static`, and
`E::ActiveModel: Send + Sync + 'static`. Duplicate names and duplicate Rust
entity types fail before the entry is added.

Copy the matching `pgorm-python/python/pgorm` facade into the application's
`python/pgorm` directory. Its Maturin configuration is:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["maturin==1.15.0"]
build-backend = "maturin"

[project]
name = "pgorm"
dynamic = ["version"]
requires-python = ">=3.14,<3.15"

[tool.maturin]
bindings = "pyo3"
python-source = "python"
module-name = "pgorm._native"
features = ["extension-module"]
```

The application crate version must match the common facade's package version
(currently 0.2.0). Build with Maturin and CPython 3.14, then install that wheel
in the application's environment. It supplies the `pgorm` distribution and
replaces the standalone wheel there. Separate extensions containing duplicate
copies of the binding classes are not a supported registration mechanism.

The independent [application crate](tests/application-binding) and
[build checker](checks/entities.py) are executable examples. The checker
materializes the facade next to the downstream Rust crate, runs Rust parity
tests, builds a wheel, and installs it into a fresh environment:

```sh
target/python-dev/bin/python pgorm-python/tests/with_postgres.py \
  target/python-dev/bin/python pgorm-python/checks/entities.py
```

An existing disposable server can instead be supplied with `PGORM_TEST_DSN`.
The checker uses its own `python_entities` schema; the database account needs
schema creation privileges. The output wheel and success report are written
under `target/python-entities`.

## Query and write

Using the example registration:

```python
import pgorm as p

Account = p.entity("app.Account")
query = Account.find().filter(Account.col("id") >= 10)
query = query.order_by(Account.col("id").expr().desc()).limit(20)
print(query.inspect().sql)

async with pool.connection() as connection:
    accounts = await query.all(connection)
    first = await query.one_opt(connection)
    active = Account.active().set("id", 42).set("display name", "Nora")
    inserted = await active.insert(connection)
    updated = await inserted.into_active().set("note", "Reviewed").update(connection)
    affected = await updated.into_active().delete(connection)
```

Entity terminals currently require an acquired `Connection`. They return
native asyncio awaitables; calling a terminal schedules its operation. Await
each operation before reusing the connection. An outstanding operation can be
cancelled through its future or `asyncio.wait_for`; cancellation discards the
connection if the operation's completion is uncertain. Closing its connection
or pool also cancels an outstanding Rust hook. Cancellation does not guarantee
rollback of a submitted write.

`all` returns a list of detached models. Rust's `one` and `one_opt` apply
`LIMIT 1`, including when an earlier query limit was larger. `one` raises
`DatabaseError` on absence; `one_opt` returns `None`. `inspect(terminal="one")`
or `inspect(terminal="one_opt")` includes that terminal's limit. A decoding
failure remains `DecodeError`. These are the registered Rust selector's
semantics; the dynamic `fetch_one` terminal has its own strict cardinality
contract. Entity streams and arbitrary partial entity projections are not
advertised by this registration API.

## Writes that return both versions

PostgreSQL 18's `RETURNING` reads a written row as it was and as the write
left it. Four entity terminals return both, through the Rust terminals that
do:

```python
Account = p.entity("app.Account")
change = await Account.update(model.into_active().set("note", "x")).returning_change(connection)
print(change.old["note"], change.new["note"])
changes = await (Account.update_many().set("note", "bulk")
                 .filter(Account.col("id") >= 2).returning_changes(connection))
renamed = p.ConflictTarget("id").update("display name")
match await Account.insert(active).on_conflict(renamed).returning_upsert(connection):
    case p.Upserted.Inserted(model): ...
    case p.Upserted.Updated(change): ...
    case None: ...  # the conflict clause wrote nothing
rows = await Account.insert_many([a, b]).on_conflict(renamed).returning_upserts(connection)
```

| Python | Rust |
| --- | --- |
| `entity.update(active).returning_change(connection)` | `Update::one(active)?.exec_returning_change` |
| `entity.update_many().set(..).filter(..).returning_changes(connection)` | `Update::many(entity).col_expr(..).filter(..).exec_returning_changes` |
| `entity.insert(active).on_conflict(..).returning_upsert(connection)` | `Insert::one(active).on_conflict(..).exec_returning_upsert` |
| `entity.insert_many(actives).on_conflict(..).returning_upserts(connection)` | `Insert::many(actives).on_conflict(..).exec_returning_upserts` |

A `Change` holds `old` and `new`, each an `EntityModel`. `Upserted` is
`Upserted.Inserted(model)` for a row the insert wrote or `Upserted.Updated(change)`
for the row its `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` updated; `into_model()` is the row as
the statement left it either way. `returning_upsert` answers `None`, and
`returning_upserts` leaves out the row, when the conflict clause did not write
it (`DO NOTHING`, or a `DO UPDATE` whose `WHERE` held it back). The conflict
action is the statement builders' own `Conflict` or `ConflictUpdate`.

These are statement terminals, as they are in Rust, so no `ActiveModelBehavior`
hook runs around them: an `update` returning its change does not bump what a
`before_save` would. With nothing set, `returning_change` sends nothing and
returns the row its key reads as both versions; a key matching no row raises
`DatabaseError`, as does `returning_changes` with nothing set (Rust's
`NothingToSet`). `update_many().set(column, value)` converts a value by the
column's declared type and writes it through the column's `save_as`, or takes
an `Expr` as written. An insert of models that set different columns is
refused, and a batch of none writes and answers nothing. Rust renames the two
versions in `RETURNING`, so an entity whose table is called `old` or `new`
still reports them in order. An ActiveModel of another registration raises
`LifecycleError`. A generated module's typed views return `Change`,
`Inserted` and `Updated` from `pgorm._registered.entities` holding its typed
models.

## Values, state and hooks

Column lookup and model keys use SQL names. `describe()` also reports the
separate JSON key, SQL type, nullability, primary key and concrete Rust type
names. Plain Python inputs use the declared SQL column type as a conversion
hint. Explicit `Value` tags preserve the caller's chosen Rust value variant;
the real Rust model/ActiveModel setter performs the final conversion checks.
An unusual custom field type may therefore require an explicit tagged value.
Qualified enum input must match the declared column enum identity. A field of a
`DeriveCreatedRange` newtype, a range type a schema created, hints its
`CreatedRange` or `CreatedMultirange` kind: a plain `pgorm.Range` or
`pgorm.Multirange` converts with the subtype's limits, a tagged value must name
the same type, and the field reads back as the range, tagged with the kind. The
Rust newtype writes it as its text cast to the type and reads a multirange
through its text, so both read through `find`.

`describe()` also reports `primary_key_without_overlaps`, true when the key's
last column is a period declared `without_overlaps` (`PRIMARY KEY (id, valid_at
WITHOUT OVERLAPS)`): the server holds a row per period, none overlapping, yet a
lookup, an update and a delete by the key still compare the period for
equality, so each names exactly one version. A filter on the whole key reads
one version back; which version covers a moment is a filter on the period, not
a key lookup. `relations` lists every variant of the entity's `Relation` enum
with its `type`, `from` and `to` tables, the `columns` paired for equality, the
`period` pair a temporal foreign key matches for overlap, and its
`enforcement` (`"not_enforced"` for a key the server never checks) and
`deferrability` (`"deferrable_initially_deferred"` for one checked at commit),
each `None` where the relation does not say.

`dict(model)` returns Python values, and `model.tagged("id")` retains the Rust
value tag. `model.with_value(column, value)` clones and calls `ModelTrait::set`;
it changes the detached model and performs no database write. `into_active()`
calls the real Rust conversion, usually producing `Unchanged` fields. To write
a changed field, call `set` on that ActiveModel.

`ActiveValue.state` distinguishes `NotSet`, `Set` and `Unchanged`.
`ActiveValue.value` is absent only for `NotSet`; a SQL NULL is an explicit
tagged value. `set`, `not_set` and `reset` return independent ActiveModel
wrappers. `Account.active()` calls the application's `ActiveModelBehavior::new`
and preserves its defaults. Each write operates on a clone, so the Python
wrapper is reusable; it is not a mutable object that marks itself saved.

Insert, update and delete run the actual before/after hooks. A before-hook
failure prevents the subsequent write. An after-hook failure is reported even
though the write may already have committed. The binding adds no implicit
transaction or retries around these methods.

Registered models decode with their actual `Model::from_query_result` and then
use checked Rust-value-to-Python conversion. Their custom Rust decoders retain
their own behavior. The additional PostgreSQL wire exactness policies for
dynamic `Record` results are scoped to that result form; they do not replace an
application's typed decoder. `capabilities()` records this distinction and
lists each registration's types and supported terminals.
