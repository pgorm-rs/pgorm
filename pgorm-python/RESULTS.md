# Executing builders and reading results

`Pool` and `Connection` execute the same native statement state returned by
`inspect()`. Accepted queries, the `pgorm.Query` alias the execution methods
are typed with, are `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Merge`, a
`Pipeline`, the schema module's `CreateTable`, `CreateIndex` and `DDL`,
`Compiled`, and explicit `RawSQL`. A `PendingMerge`, a MERGE with no WHEN arm,
is not one: execution refuses it with `ConstructionError`. Ordinary strings
are not queries. No HTTP
service, query dispatcher, compiler or extension build runs per query.

```python
import os
from pgorm import Pool, Table, select, update

async def visit(account_id: int):
    accounts = Table("accounts", schema="application")
    async with Pool(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]) as pool:
        query = update(accounts).set("visits", accounts.col("visits") + 1)
        affected = await pool.execute(query.where(accounts.col("id") == account_id))
        account = await pool.optional(
            select(accounts.star()).from_(accounts)
            .where(accounts.col("id") == account_id)
        )
        return affected, account
```

The application table must already exist. These two calls are separate
statements. Atomic multi-statement work requires the transaction API when
available in the installed capability manifest.

| Terminal | Result | Cardinality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `await execute(query)` | `int` command affected count | PostgreSQL's count, including zero |
| `await query(query)` | `list[Record]` | Zero or more |
| `await one(query)` | `Record` | Exactly one, otherwise `DecodeError` |
| `await optional(query)` | `Record \| None` | At most one, otherwise `DecodeError` |
| `await stream(query)` | `RowStream` async iterator | Zero or more, one pull at a time |

`query`, `one` and `optional` materialize the complete result through
`ConnectionTrait::query_all`; they do not inject a limit. Use a builder limit
when the query should be bounded, or streaming for a large result.

The executor passes the Rust-built SQL and `ValueHolder` parameters to pgorm's
ordinary cached `ConnectionTrait` methods. PostgreSQL infers placeholder types
from the statement, just as it does for Rust callers. A standalone `SELECT $1`
has insufficient context for a numeric parameter; supply a qualified cast,
for example `bind(7).cast(TypeName("int8", schema="pg_catalog"))`.

## Detached records

Records own their data after the connection closes. `row["name"]`, `get`,
`keys`, `values`, `items`, iteration and `dict(row)` expose ordinary Python
values. `row.tagged("name")` returns an immutable `Value`, retaining distinctions
such as SQL NULL versus JSON null and a nullable `int4` versus nullable `int8`.
Each access returns an independently owned Python container for JSON/arrays.

`row.fields` is an immutable tuple of `Field` objects. Fields retain output
name and position, qualified PostgreSQL type name and OID, and source table
OID/column number when PostgreSQL supplies them. Duplicate output names raise
`DecodeError`; alias projections explicitly. A left join with no matching row
returns typed NULL fields in a record. Dynamic records do not claim compiled
entity or optional-model decoding; those terminals belong to registered
entity/graph shapes advertised by the capability manifest.

The decoder uses `tokio_postgres::Row::try_get<Option<T>>` and the driver's
Rust `FromSql` implementations, the same underlying path used by pgorm's
`TryGetable`. Enum labels retain the driver's qualified `Type` identity.
INET/MAC adapters invoke the Rust `postgres_protocol` codecs also used by
pgorm's `TryGetable`. Conversions then use the public `Value` conversion path.

| PostgreSQL output | Native value tag / Python value |
| --- | --- |
| bool; internal `char`; int2/int4/int8; oid | bool; i8; i16/i32/i64; u32 |
| float4/float8 | f32/f64; Python float, including signed zero/NaN/infinity |
| text/varchar/bpchar/name; bytea | text / str; bytes |
| json/jsonb | json / dict, list, scalar or None; SQL NULL stays distinct |
| numeric | decimal / Decimal, exact 96-bit coefficient and scale 0–28 |
| uuid | uuid / UUID |
| date; time; timestamp | date; time; datetime, microsecond precision |
| timestamptz | datetime_utc / timezone-aware UTC datetime |
| inet/cidr; macaddr | ipnetwork / string; mac_address / six bytes |
| enum | enum / label, qualified `TypeName` retained |
| supported scalar array | array / list, including nullable elements |
| int4range … tstzrange; int4multirange … tstzmultirange | the range type's name / `pgorm.Range`, `pgorm.Multirange` |
| a range type a schema created | created_range, its `CreatedRange` named as the column's type / `pgorm.Range` |
| pgvector `vector`, when installed in PostgreSQL | vector / list of f32 values |

PostgreSQL stores a timestamptz instant without its input timezone; decoded
values therefore use UTC. Numeric values requiring rounding, non-finite
numeric, temporal values outside Python's range, `24:00:00`, and f32 NaN
payloads Python cannot preserve raise `DecodeError`. JSON uses Rust
serde_json's i64/u64/f64 number model. Numeric spellings that change value
when decoded, integers beyond i64/u64, and nesting beyond 64 levels are
rejected. JSON object ordering/whitespace are not retained.

Arrays must have at most one dimension and lower bound 1; an empty array and
an SQL NULL array remain distinct. A range type a schema created decodes as
its own kind, whatever its subtype, from its binary form through the subtype's
codec ([VALUES.md](VALUES.md#range-types-a-schema-created)). The driver
reports a multirange a schema created as a simple type, so a column of one,
like an array of a created range, raises `DecodeError`; read it cast to `text`.
A range's numeric bound is held to the exactness a numeric column is.
Multi-dimensional/non-default-bound arrays,
domains, composites, `timetz` and unlisted types raise `DecodeError`,
including typed NULLs of unsupported types. A query/decode error never becomes
an empty list, `None`, or stream exhaustion. Server errors retain SQLSTATE;
local cardinality errors have no PostgreSQL SQLSTATE.

## Streaming and cancellation

```python
async with Pool(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]) as pool:
    query = select(accounts.star()).from_(accounts).order_by(accounts.col("id").asc())
    async with await pool.stream(query) as rows:
        async for row in rows:
            print(row["id"])
            if row["id"] == 100:
                break
```

A pool stream checks out one connection and retains it until EOF or close.
A connection stream reserves that connection; other operations fail with
`LifecycleError` while it is active. EOF leaves the connection reusable.
Early close, decode failure or cancellation discards the incomplete connection.
Explicit `aclose()` and the context manager provide deterministic cleanup;
dropping the iterator also cancels and releases its native lease. A stream
raises `ConstructionError` on truth testing, as `CopyOutStream`,
`CopyRowStream` and `Listener` do: its truth would say nothing of whether
rows remain, so `if rows:` is refused where it is written.

`RowStream` wraps the row stream pgorm's `query_raw` returns, without collecting
the result or adding a prefetch queue. The driver uses a bounded response
channel and socket backpressure; only one Python `next` operation may run at
a time. Buffer memory still depends on row/message size. This is a client
stream, not a PostgreSQL server-side cursor or a limit on server query work.

Pool or connection shutdown also interrupts an idle stream, so closing an
owner does not wait for the next Python iteration. Resources remain bound to
their original asyncio loop. `asyncio.timeout()`/task cancellation discard an
active query connection whose state is uncertain; cancellation never promises
rollback of an already submitted write. No query is retried by the binding.

## Notifications

```python
async with Pool(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]) as pool:
    async with await pool.listener() as listener:
        await listener.listen("jobs")
        async with pool.transaction() as tx:
            await tx.notify("jobs", "42")
        async for notification in listener:
            print(notification.channel, notification.payload, notification.process_id)
            break
```

`pool.listener()` opens a connection of its own with the pool's configuration
and TLS, outside the pool's size: PostgreSQL delivers a notification only to
the session that listened, which a pooled connection, lent onward once
returned, cannot be. Closing the pool closes its listeners. `listen`,
`unlisten` and `unlisten_all` change what it receives and may run while
another task iterates it. A channel name is exact, sent as a quoted
identifier, and one longer than 63 bytes raises `ConstructionError`, and one
that is no `str` `TypeError`, before anything is sent.

Iteration yields `Notification` objects in the order PostgreSQL sent them:
commit order across transactions, a rolled-back transaction's never. At most
`capacity` (default 1024, a positive `int`: another type raises `TypeError` and
a value below 1 `ValueError`) wait unread; one more closes the listener, and
iteration raises `ConnectionError` after yielding those waiting. A failed or
terminated connection raises its error the same way. Nothing reconnects,
since a notification sent while nothing listened is lost and the reader must
re-read what it tracks. Only one pull may run at a time; a cancelled pull
loses nothing, while a cancelled `listen`, `unlisten` or `unlisten_all` closes
the listener, since what the server did is then unknown. Closing the listener
ends iteration, a pull waiting on it included.

`notify(channel, payload)` on a pool, connection or transaction sends
`SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)` with both values bound, delivered when the
transaction commits. The server refuses a payload of 8000 bytes or more
(`DatabaseError`, SQLSTATE `22023`).

## Verification

Run the installed-wheel suite through the disposable PostgreSQL wrapper in
the package README. `test_results.py` checks command counts, CRUD records,
cardinality, type metadata and exact/rejected decoding. `test_streams.py`
checks reservation, exhaustion, abandonment, cancellation and shutdown with
one-second operation budgets. Native codec parity tests run with:

```sh
PYO3_PYTHON="$PWD/target/python-dev/bin/python" \
  cargo test --manifest-path pgorm-python/Cargo.toml --target-dir target --locked --lib
```
