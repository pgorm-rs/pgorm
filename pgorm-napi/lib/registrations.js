// What a module generated for an application's registrations holds it to:
// the fingerprint of the addon's version and every registration it names, as
// the module's own entity(), graph() and pipeline sources() describe them.
// The generator computes it as it writes the module, and the module checks
// it as it loads, so a module meeting a native build its declarations no
// longer describe fails at once rather than mistyping a record.
// [spec:pgorm:req:napi.codegen]
