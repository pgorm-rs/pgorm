// A process that has finished its work exits on its own, in either runtime.
//
// The addon's promises are settled through Node-API threadsafe functions, and
// its queries run on a tokio runtime whose threads outlive any one call. Either
// could keep a finished process alive or crash it as it exits. Each case runs a
// fixture in a fresh process of the runtime running the suite and holds it to
// exiting by itself, before a deadline, with the status it should have and
// nothing on stderr it should not.
