# Generate an application module

`pgorm-napi/codegen` writes, from a build description, the native module of
an application's registered entities ([ENTITIES.md](ENTITIES.md)) and a
TypeScript module typing each of its registrations from what the built
library describes: records keyed by SQL column with each column's type,
nullability and an enum's labels, graph rows and source-tuple rows as tuples
of those records. It is pgorm-python's [code generator](../pgorm-python/CODEGEN.md)
for JavaScript: a build, then generation; constructing and running queries
over the generated module needs neither.

## Describe the application

The application's entity crate holds ordinary Rust: entities, and functions
building each `SelectGraph` from the aliases JavaScript chooses — whether
written by hand or by `pgorm-codegen` from a live schema. Beside it, an
`application.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "module": "app",
  "entity_crate": ".",
  "entities": [
    {"name": "app.Account", "rust": "account::Entity", "typescript": "Account"},
    {"name": "app.Note", "rust": "note::Entity", "typescript": "Note"}
  ],
  "graphs": [
    {"name": "app.AccountNotes", "rust": "optional", "typescript": "AccountNotes"}
  ],
  "sources": [
    {"name": "app.AccountWithNote", "rust": ["account::Entity", "note::Entity"], "typescript": "AccountWithNote"}
  ]
}
```

`entity_crate` is relative to the file. A Rust path names modules and an item
of that crate — no expression, generic or keyword. Registration names are
unique per kind, each Rust entity is registered once, a source tuple lists one
to six of the described entities, and every `typescript` export is a public
JavaScript identifier no other export or the module takes. Anything else is a
`CodegenError` before a file is written.

## Scaffold, build, emit

```sh
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js scaffold application.json --pgorm-source "$PGORM_SOURCE" --output app-module
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js build app-module            # --release for an optimised library
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js emit app-module
```

- **scaffold** writes a crate registering the described entities, graphs and
  tuples in its own `#[neon::main]`, depending on the checkout's pgorm-napi
  without its `standalone-module` feature, its lockfile seeded from
  pgorm-napi's so the crates they share resolve to the audited versions;
  a copy of the binding's ES module under `lib/`; and the resolved
  description as `application.json`. It refuses an existing destination.
- **build** compiles the crate and places its library as `lib/pgorm_napi.node`,
  the addon the copied `index.js` loads. Keep the project's `Cargo.lock` for
  reproducible rebuilds.
- **emit** loads the built module and writes `lib/<module>.js` and
  `lib/<module>.d.ts`. Emitting again from the same library writes the same
  bytes.

## Use the generated module

```ts
import { Account, AccountNotes, AccountWithNote } from "./app-module/lib/app.js";
import { pipeline as pl } from "./app-module/lib/index.js";

const busy = await Account.find().where(Account.col("mood").eq("busy")).all(pool);  // AccountRecord[]
busy[0]?.["display name"];                                                           // string
const saved = await Account.active().set("id", 3).set("display name", "Cy").insert(pool);
for (const [account, note] of await AccountNotes.find({ aliases: ["n"] }).all(pool)) {
  note?.body;                                                                         // NoteRecord | null
}
const pairs = await pl.from(Account).selectSources(AccountWithNote).all(pool);      // [AccountRecord | null, NoteRecord | null][]
```

For each entity the declarations export `NameRecord` — its columns by SQL
name, typed as the library decodes them, `| null` where the column is
nullable, an enum's labels as a union, an array's items `| null` unless the
entity's Rust field is a `Vec` of a type that is no `Option` — and `NameInput`,
what each column takes, and type the export as an `Entity` over both, so
`col(..)` comparisons, ActiveModel `set`s, records and the version terminals
are typed. A graph exports `NameRow`, the root's record for a slotless shape
and otherwise a tuple whose `Opt` slots are `| null`; a source tuple exports
`NameRow`, a tuple of `Record | null`. A column of a type the binding has no
kind for reads as `PlainValue` and takes a `Value`.

The generated module records a fingerprint of the addon's version and every
registration it names, as the library describes them, and checks it as it
loads: a library rebuilt from changed entities, hooks aside, refuses to load
behind declarations it no longer matches, with a `ConstructionError` asking to
regenerate. Rebuild and regenerate whenever the entity crate changes.

## Verify the workflow

```sh
node pgorm-napi/checks/codegen.js
```

The check scaffolds `tests/codegen-entities` under `target/napi-codegen`,
refuses to scaffold over it, builds and emits twice to check determinism,
type-checks the fixture's consumer with `deno check` — its
`@ts-expect-error` lines hold the declarations to what they refuse — loads a
copy of the module with another fingerprint in both runtimes and requires the
refusal, and runs the fixture's live suite under `node --test` and
`deno test`. It reads `PGORM_TEST_DSN`, or the server `DATABASE_URL` names.
