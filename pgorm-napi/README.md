# pgorm-napi

pgorm from Node.js and Deno: a Node-API addon built with
[Neon](https://neon-bindings.com), and the ES module that loads it. It is the
JavaScript counterpart of `pgorm-python`, and like it lives in its own Cargo
workspace so that ordinary pgorm builds never meet it. The rules it follows
are [docs/spec/napi.md](../docs/spec/napi.md).

The addon loads in both runtimes, runs pgorm's asynchronous work on a tokio
runtime of its own, settles a Promise with the outcome, and lets the process
exit when its work is done. JavaScript connects through pools, runs bound SQL,
scopes transactions and savepoints, streams rows, runs COPY and listens for
notifications ([Connections](#connections)), builds pgorm-query's statements
([Statements](#statements)), DDL ([Schema](#schema)) and pipelines
([Pipelines](#pipelines)), declares models and reads and writes them, their
relations and graphs ([Models](#models)), and every value pgorm holds crosses
into and out of JavaScript with a declared type ([Values](#values)). It needs
a runtime with `Temporal` as a global: Node.js 26 or later, or Deno 2.9.5 or
later.

## Installing

pgorm-napi is packaged for npm: a main package, `@necessary/pgorm`, of
JavaScript and declarations, and a package per platform holding its prebuilt
addon, `@necessary/pgorm-<os>-<cpu>[-<libc>]`, which npm and Deno install
beside it — macOS arm64 and Linux x86-64 (glibc) today.

```sh
npm install @necessary/pgorm
```

```json
{
  "nodeModulesDir": "auto",
  "imports": { "@necessary/pgorm": "npm:@necessary/pgorm@^0.2.0" }
}
```

The second is a Deno project's `deno.json`; `deno install` then fetches the
packages. CI builds the packages, installs them in both runtimes and keeps the
tarballs, but nothing is published to npm yet; meanwhile, build from a
checkout. [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md)
covers the packages, the platforms, what Deno's `--allow-ffi` grants, the
dependency notices and how the packages are built and checked.

## Building

```sh
node pgorm-napi/scripts/build.mjs            # debug build
node pgorm-napi/scripts/build.mjs --release  # release build, as the packages ship it
```

The script runs Cargo (into the repository's `target/` unless
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` says otherwise) and copies the library it produces to
`pgorm-napi/lib/pgorm_napi.node`, which git ignores. A release build uses the
crate's `addon` profile, Cargo's release profile with fat LTO, one codegen
unit and the symbol table stripped: about 11.8 MB on macOS arm64 rather than
23 MB, at the cost of a longer link
([DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md#the-addons-size)). The addon targets
Node-API 6 and resolves its Node-API symbols from whichever runtime loads it,
so one build serves both. The module loads a library it finds there before
looking for an installed platform package, so a checkout runs its own build.

## Loading

Import the module, never the `.node` file — `@necessary/pgorm` once
installed, as the examples here do, or `./pgorm-napi/lib/index.js` from a
checkout:

```js
import { DatabaseError, Pool } from "@necessary/pgorm";

await using pool = new Pool("postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres?sslmode=disable");
try {
  const row = await pool.one("SELECT $1::int8 + 1 AS n", [41]);
  console.log(row.n); // 42n
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof DatabaseError) console.error(error.sqlstate, error.message);
  else throw error;
}
```

- **Node.js** loads it as is: `node app.js`.
- **Deno** needs `--allow-ffi`, to open a native library, and `--allow-read`,
  to resolve its path: `deno run --allow-ffi --allow-read app.ts`. Native code
  runs outside Deno's permission checks, so `--allow-net` is neither needed
  nor a limit on what the addon reaches; granting `--allow-ffi` to a program
  that loads it trusts it with everything the process can do.

`lib/index.d.ts` declares every export, and Deno finds it through the module's
`@ts-self-types` directive.

## Connections

```js
import { connect } from "@necessary/pgorm";

await using pool = await connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { maxSize: 10 });

await pool.execute("UPDATE accounts SET visits = visits + 1 WHERE id = $1", [7]);  // affected rows
const rows = await pool.query("SELECT id, name FROM accounts WHERE id = ANY($1)", [[1, 2, 3]]);
const row = await pool.one("SELECT now() AS at");               // exactly one row
const maybe = await pool.optional("SELECT 1 WHERE false");       // null

await pool.transaction(async (tx) => {                           // commits, or rolls back on throw
  await tx.execute("INSERT INTO audit VALUES ($1)", ["visit"]);
  await tx.transaction(async (savepoint) => { /* rolled back alone if it throws */ });
});

for await (const account of pool.stream("SELECT * FROM accounts")) {
  if (account.id === 100) break;                                // releases the connection
}

await pool.execute("SELECT pg_sleep(10)", [], { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000) });  // rejects after 1 s
```

- **`Pool`** builds from a connection string and options (`tls`, `ca`,
  `maxSize`, `connectTimeout`, `acquireTimeout`, `statementCacheSize`,
  `recycle`; durations in milliseconds) without sending anything; `connect`
  also pings. TLS is `verify-full` — certificate and host name checked against
  `ca` or the platform's trust store — unless the string says
  `sslmode=disable` or `tls` is `"disable"`, and never falls back to plaintext.
  A statement run on a pool takes a connection for itself alone.
- **`Connection`** (from `pool.acquire()`) is the caller's until closed, and
  runs one operation at a time; another meanwhile is a `LifecycleError`, not a
  queue.
- **`Transaction`** comes from `begin()` (then `commit()` or `rollback()`) or
  `transaction(fn)`, which commits when `fn` resolves and rolls back when it
  throws, rejecting with `fn`'s own error. On a transaction, `begin` and
  `transaction` open savepoints. A transaction borrows its parent exclusively,
  as in Rust: while a savepoint is open its transaction refuses statements,
  commits and other savepoints, and while a transaction is open its connection
  refuses other work — refused with a `LifecycleError`, never raced. `mode`
  (`"readWrite"`, `"readOnly"`, `"deferrable"`) and `isolation` choose how it
  opens.
- **`execute`, `query`, `one`, `optional`** are on all three; `one` and
  `optional` reject a row count they do not admit with a `DecodeError`.
  `{ tagged: true }` gives `Value`s.
- **`stream`** on a pool or connection is an async iterator pulling one row
  per `next()`, so an unread result holds the server back. Its connection is
  freed at the last row; leaving the loop early, `return()` or `close()`
  discards it, because rows were left unread on it.
- **`signal`**: acquiring, running a statement, opening a transaction or
  savepoint and pulling a stream's rows each take an `AbortSignal`. Aborting
  rejects with the signal's reason and discards the connection the operation
  ran on — its outcome is unknown — ending any transaction on it.
- **Releasing**: every handle has `close()` and works with `await using`.
  Closing a connection returns it to its pool at once; closing a pool cancels
  what runs and waits until every connection is released. Nothing waits on
  garbage collection: a handle collected unclosed releases only what is idle,
  rolling back an idle transaction and returning an idle connection, and never
  cuts short work still running.

`TimeoutError` is a pool's `acquireTimeout` running out; an `AbortSignal`
timeout rejects with the signal's own `TimeoutError` `DOMException`.

### COPY

```js
import { col, copyFrom, copyTo, select, Table } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const load = copyFrom("accounts", "csv").columns(["id", "name"]).header();
await pool.copyIn(load, fs.createReadStream("accounts.csv"));        // rows written

const dump = copyTo(select(col("id"), col("name")).from(new Table("accounts")).where(col("active").eq(true)), "binary");
for await (const chunk of await pool.copyOut(dump)) output.write(chunk);   // Uint8Array chunks
```

- **`copyFrom(table, format)`** and **`copyTo(source, format)`** build
  `COPY … FROM STDIN` and `COPY … TO STDOUT` in `"text"`, `"csv"` or
  `"binary"`; a COPY TO reads a table, or a `select`, or a write with a
  `returning` list, and a write without one is a `ConstructionError` when
  `copyTo` is called. The format is the builder's type: an option it does not
  take — `quote` on text, `header` on binary, `freeze` on a COPY TO — is no
  method of its type, and called anyway is a `ConstructionError`. COPY takes
  no parameters, so a value in its `where` or query is written into the SQL as
  a literal, and `inspect()` gives no values; `execute` and the other
  terminals refuse a COPY.
- **`copyIn(statement, source)`** on a pool, connection or transaction writes
  a `Uint8Array`, or an iterable or async iterable of them — a generator, a
  web `ReadableStream`, a Node.js stream of buffers — pulling the next chunk
  only as the COPY takes the last, and resolves with the rows written. A
  source that throws, or yields anything but a `Uint8Array`, abandons the
  COPY — nothing is written; inside a transaction it is aborted until rolled
  back — and the promise rejects with that error. A row the server refuses
  rejects with its `DatabaseError` once the data is sent.
- **`copyOut(statement)`** resolves, once the server accepts the statement,
  with a `CopyOutStream` of `Uint8Array` chunks, one per `next()`; a chunk is
  a piece of the format's byte stream, not a row.
- A COPY holds what it runs on — a pool's takes a connection of its own; a
  connection or transaction refuses other work with a `LifecycleError` until
  the COPY ends — and, unlike `stream`, it runs in a transaction. Leaving a
  `CopyOutStream` early, or aborting a COPY with its `signal`, discards the
  connection; an aborted COPY in a transaction ends it.

### LISTEN and NOTIFY

```js
await using listener = await pool.listener({ capacity: 1024 });
await listener.listen("jobs");                                    // exact name: case and punctuation kept

await pool.transaction(async (tx) => {
  await tx.notify("jobs", JSON.stringify({ id: 42 }));            // delivered at commit
});

for await (const { channel, payload, processId } of listener) {
  console.log(channel, payload, processId);
}
```

- **`pool.listener()`** opens a `Listener` on a connection of its own, with
  the pool's configuration and TLS; it is not one the pool lends, and it
  closes with the pool. `listen`, `unlisten` and `unlistenAll` change its
  channels, and may run while a pull waits; a channel name longer than 63
  bytes is a `ConstructionError`, since PostgreSQL would listen on it
  truncated.
- The listener is an async iterator of frozen `{ channel, payload, processId
  }` notifications, one per `next()`, in the order the server sent them;
  another pull while one waits is a `LifecycleError`. Nothing reconnects it:
  a lost connection ends it with that failure after the notifications already
  received, and a notification arriving while `capacity` wait unread closes it
  with a `ConnectionError`, since one would otherwise be lost. Either way,
  re-read what the notifications were tracking and open a new listener.
- `next({ signal })` takes an `AbortSignal`, and an aborted pull leaves the
  listener open; an aborted `listen` or `unlisten` closes it, since the
  server may have acted on it. `close()`, `await using` and a `for await`
  loop leaving early close the listener and its connection.
- **`notify(channel, payload)`** on a pool, connection or transaction sends
  `SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)` with both bound; in a transaction it is
  delivered when the transaction commits, and never if it rolls back. A
  payload of 8000 bytes or more is the server's `DatabaseError`.

## Statements

pgorm-query's statements and expressions are built from JavaScript as
pgorm-python builds them, and run through the same terminals as SQL text:

```js
import { Condition, call, col, select, Table, With } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const account = new Table("account", { schema: "app", alias: "a" });
const event = new Table("event", { alias: "e" });
const clicks = call("count", event.col("id"));

const query = select(account.col("name"), clicks.as("clicks"))
  .from(account)
  .join(event, account.col("id").eq(event.col("account_id")), { kind: "left" })
  .where(Condition.any(account.col("active").eq(true), account.col("mood").isNull()))
  .groupBy(account.col("name"))
  .having(clicks.gte(1))
  .orderBy(clicks.desc({ nulls: "last" }))
  .limit(10);

query.inspect();               // { sql: 'SELECT "a"."name", COUNT("e"."id") AS ..', values: [Value, ..] }
await pool.query(query);       // built as inspect() builds it; options come second
for await (const row of pool.stream(query, { tagged: true })) { /* .. */ }
```

- **Builders never change.** Each method returns a new builder from a copy of
  its receiver's pgorm-query state, so a base query can be extended in two
  directions. Builders come from the module's functions (`select`, `col`,
  `bind`, `call`, `caseWhen`, `caseOf`, `exists`, `scalar`, `tuple`,
  `groupingSet`, `rollup`, `cube`, `groupingSets`, `tableFunction`) and the
  `Table` and `With` constructors.
- **Values are bound, identifiers quoted.** An operand that is not an
  expression is a parameter, inferred as one is or declared with `Value` — an
  enum's label is cast to its type. `null` is refused (test with `isNull()`, or
  bind `Value.null(kind)`). An `Interval`, or a `Temporal.Duration`, binds as
  pgorm's interval value, its months, days and microseconds kept apart. A name
  is 1–63 bytes, always an identifier, its dots included.
- **Expressions**: comparisons and arithmetic (`eq` .. `gte`, `add` .. `mod`,
  `concat`), `and`/`or`/`not` and `Condition.all`/`any`, `isNull`, `isIn` a list
  or a `Select`, `between` (`{ symmetric }`), `like`/`ilike`/`similarTo` with
  an `escape`, `startsWith`/`endsWith`/`containsText` (text, not patterns),
  `cast`, `collate`, `at`/`slice`, `caseWhen(..).when(..).else(..)`,
  `caseOf(x).when(..)`, `call` for the functions pgorm-query constructs
  (`uuidv7` and its shift among them, and the set-returning `generate_series`
  and `unnest`, whose overloads need a bound argument typed:
  `bind(1).cast("int8")`), `exists` and `scalar`.
- **SELECT**: `select(..)`, `from`, `join` (`kind`, `lateral`), `crossJoin`,
  `where`, `groupBy` (expressions, and `groupingSet`, `rollup`, `cube` and
  `groupingSets`), `groupByDistinct`, `having`, `orderBy`, `limit`/`offset`
  (`null` removes), `limitWithTies` (`FETCH FIRST n ROWS WITH TIES`, in
  LIMIT's slot), `distinct`, `union` .. `exceptAll`, `lock("update", { of,
  wait })`, `with`, and `as(alias)` to read a query as a FROM item.
  `tableFunction(calls, { alias, ordinality, columns, rowsFrom })` reads
  set-returning calls as one — `ROWS FROM` over several — and
  `table.tablesample("bernoulli" | "system", percentage, { repeatable })`
  samples a table. `new With(name, query, { columns, materialized }).cte(..)`
  and `With.recursive(name, query, { search, cycle })` are its common table
  expressions.
- **Refusals happen as a builder is called**: an argument that cannot be built
  — an unknown function, a negative limit, a LIKE escape of two characters, an
  empty tuple — throws a `ConstructionError` there, so a statement that cannot
  be built never exists. A statement binding more than 65,535 values is refused
  before anything is sent, and so is a tie limit with no ORDER BY or beside
  SKIP LOCKED — by `inspect()` and every terminal, since the order may come
  after the limit, and as soon as such a query is read into another
  statement.

### Writes

```js
import { col, Conflict, deleteFrom, insert, ReturningRow, Table, update } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const account = new Table("account", { schema: "app" });

await pool.query(
  insert(account).columns("id", "name").values(1, "Alice").values(2, "Bob")
    .onConflict(Conflict.on("id").update("name"))
    .returning([col("id"), ReturningRow.old.col("id").isNull().as("inserted")]),
);
await pool.execute(update(account).set("visits", col("visits").add(1)).where(col("id").eq(1)));
await pool.query(deleteFrom(account).where(col("active").eq(false)).returning([ReturningRow.old.star()]));
```

- **INSERT** names its distinct columns once, then takes rows: `values(..)` per
  row, checked against the columns' count, `select(query)`, or
  `defaultValues()` with no columns. `overriding("systemValue" | "userValue")`
  is for identity columns.
- **Conflicts** are an arbiter and an action: `Conflict.doNothing()` for any
  conflict, or `Conflict.on(column | expression, ..)` — with `.where(..)` for a
  partial index — or `Conflict.onConstraint(name)`, followed by `.doNothing()`,
  `.update(column, ..)` (from `EXCLUDED`) or `.set(column, value)`, an update
  taking a `.where(..)` of its own. A target without its action is refused.
- **UPDATE** assigns each column once with `set`; **DELETE** comes from
  `deleteFrom`. Each needs `where(..)` or an explicit `allRows()` before it runs,
  and `from(item)` / `using(item)` add the items it reads.
- **RETURNING**: `returning(items, { oldAs, newAs })`, every column when
  `items` is empty. `ReturningRow.old` and `ReturningRow.new` read the row
  before and after the write; a renamed version answers only to its new name,
  `col(name, { table: newName })`.
- A write with a RETURNING list is a common table expression's body, and every
  write takes `with(..)`.
- An INSERT with no rows, an UPDATE with no assignment and an UPDATE or DELETE
  with neither `where` nor `allRows()` are refused, by `inspect()` and the
  terminals alike, before anything is sent.

### MERGE

```js
import { merge, MergeAction, ReturningRow, Table } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const target = new Table("account", { alias: "t" });
const source = new Table("staged", { alias: "s" });

await pool.query(
  merge(target, source, target.col("id").eq(source.col("id")))
    .whenMatched(MergeAction.update("name", source.col("name")).set("visits", target.col("visits").add(1)))
    .whenMatched(MergeAction.delete(), { condition: source.col("name").isNull() })
    .whenNotMatched(MergeAction.insert("id", source.col("id")).set("name", source.col("name")))
    .whenNotMatchedBySource(MergeAction.delete())
    .returningAction()
    .returning([target.col("id"), ReturningRow.old.col("name").as("was")]),
);
```

`merge(target, source, on)` gives a `PendingMerge`, which has no `inspect()`
and which every terminal refuses: PostgreSQL refuses a MERGE with no WHEN arm.
Its first arm gives the `Merge`. An arm takes only what its kind of row can
take — a target row (`whenMatched`, `whenNotMatchedBySource`) is updated,
deleted or left alone, a source row (`whenNotMatched`) is inserted or skipped —
and anything else is a `ConstructionError`. `MergeAction.update` and `.insert`
take their first column at once, so neither is ever empty. Within a kind of
row, a row takes the first conditional arm whose condition holds, otherwise the
one unconditional arm, which renders last; `returningAction()` puts
`merge_action()` first in the RETURNING list, `only()` writes `ONLY`, and a
MERGE takes a plain WITH clause and is one's body when it returns rows. The
source may be a `Table` or a `FromItem`, a subquery among them.

### SQL/JSON, windows and ranges

```js
import {
  call, col, FrameType, jsonDefault, jsonExists, jsonTable, JsonTableColumn as C, jsonValue,
  Range, select, Table, Value, Window, windowFunction,
} from "@necessary/pgorm";

const docs = new Table("docs", { alias: "d" });
const size = jsonValue(docs.col("doc"), "$.size", { returning: "integer", onEmpty: jsonDefault(0), onError: "error" });
const blue = jsonExists(docs.col("doc"), "$.tags[*] ? (@ == $Tag)", { passing: { Tag: "blue" } });
const items = jsonTable(docs.col("doc"), "$.items[*]", [C.ordinality("i"), C.value("n", "integer")], { alias: "jt" });
await pool.query(select(docs.col("id"), size.as("size"), items.col("n")).from(docs).from(items).where(blue));

const running = new Window().partitionBy(col("kind")).orderBy(col("at").asc())
  .frame(FrameType.rows.preceding(1).andFollowing(1).exclude("currentRow"));
await pool.query(select(call("sum", col("weight")).over(running).as("around"), windowFunction("rank").over("w"))
  .from(new Table("reading")).window("w", new Window().orderBy(col("weight").desc())));

await pool.query(select().from(new Table("booking"))
  .where(col("seats").overlaps(new Value(new Range(1, 10, "[]"), "int4range"))));
```

- **SQL/JSON**: `jsonExists`, `jsonValue`, `jsonQuery`, `jsonObject`,
  `jsonArray`, `jsonArrayQuery`, `jsonObjectAgg`, `jsonArrayAgg`, `jsonParse`
  (`JSON(..)`), `jsonScalar`, `jsonSerialize`, `formatJson` and
  `isJson`/`isNotJson`. A path is bound as `jsonpath`, PASSING takes an object
  of names to values, and each function takes only its own behaviours —
  `jsonExists` `"true" | "false" | "unknown" | "error"`, `jsonValue` `"null" |
  "error" | jsonDefault(v)`, `jsonQuery` those and `"emptyArray" |
  "emptyObject"`, with one `shaping`. `jsonValue` refuses to return `json` or
  `jsonb`; `jsonQuery` reads JSON out instead. RETURNING and JSON_TABLE's
  columns take a `DataType` — `new DataType("numeric", { precision, scale })`,
  `.array()` — or a built-in type's name.
- **JSON_TABLE** is a FROM item: `jsonTable(context, path, columns, { alias,
  passing, pathName, onError })`, its columns `JsonTableColumn.ordinality`,
  `.value`, `.query`, `.exists` and `.nested`, each with its own options. It
  needs a column and an alias, and is implicitly LATERAL, so `join(items,
  bind(true), { kind: "left" })` keeps a row whose document yields nothing.
- **Windows**: `expr.over(window | name)` on a function call or a JSON
  aggregate; `new Window().partitionBy(..).orderBy(..).frame(..)`; frames from
  `FrameType.rows`, `.range` or `.groups` offer only the ends that may follow
  their start; `windowFunction(name, ..)` for `row_number`, `rank`, `lag` and
  the others, usable only with `over`. Each `select.window(name, window)`
  appends an entry to the WINDOW clause, and `new ExtendedWindow(base)` builds
  one on an earlier entry, copying its partitioning and any ordering and
  adding `orderBy(..)` and `frame(..)`. A clause PostgreSQL refuses — a name
  declared twice, an extended window whose base is no earlier entry, has a
  frame, or already orders its rows when it adds an ORDER BY — and an
  `over(name)` no entry declares are a `ConstructionError` when the statement
  is inspected, run or read into another.
- **Ranges**: `contains` (`@>`), `containedBy` (`<@`) and `overlaps` (`&&`)
  over ranges, multiranges and arrays. A range binds as a `Value` naming its
  kind — a built-in one or a `CreatedRange` — never inferred.

## Models

A model is a table and its columns, declared in JavaScript and lowered into
the statement builders, as pgorm-python's `Model` is: declaring one sends
nothing, runs no DDL and stands for no Rust entity. Its reads decode into
records — plain objects keyed by field — and its relations, graphs, cursors
and pages follow pgorm's own `RelationDef`, `SelectGraph`, `Cursor` and
`Paginator`, down to the SQL they write.

```ts
import { column, Conflict, model, type RowOf, TypeName } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const Account = model("account", {
  schema: "app",
  columns: {
    id: column("i64", { primaryKey: true, generated: "byDefault" }),
    name: column("text"),
    displayName: column("text", { name: "display_name", nullable: true }),
    mood: column(new TypeName("mood", { schema: "app" }), { values: ["calm", "glad"], nullable: true }),
    tags: column("text", { array: true, default: true }),
  },
});
const Post = model("post", {
  schema: "app",
  columns: { id: column("i64", { primaryKey: true }), authorId: column("i64", { name: "author_id" }), title: column("text") },
});
const posts = Account.hasMany(Post, { from: "id", to: "authorId" });
const author = Post.belongsTo(Account, { from: "authorId", to: "id" });

type Account = RowOf<typeof Account>; // { id: bigint; name: string; displayName: string | null; mood: "calm" | "glad" | null; .. }

const ann = await Account.insert({ name: "Ann", mood: "calm" }).returning().one(pool);
await Account.update({ displayName: null }).where(Account.key({ id: ann.id })).execute(pool);
const { old, new: now } = await Account.update({ name: "Anne" }).where(Account.key({ id: ann.id })).returningChange(pool);
const upserted = await Account.insert({ id: 1, name: "Ann" }).onConflict(Conflict.on("id").update("name")).returningUpsert(pool);

const calm = await Account.find().where(Account.col("mood").eq("calm")).orderBy(Account.col("id").asc()).all(pool);
const authored = await posts.load(pool, calm);                         // one query: a list of posts per account
for (const [post, by] of await Post.graph().joinOne(author).all(pool)) { /* .. */ }
const page = await Account.find().cursor("name", "id").after("Ann", 1n).first(20).all(pool);
const pages = Account.find().orderBy(Account.col("id").asc()).paginate(50);
```

- **Why a factory.** `model(name, { columns })` infers everything from one
  object literal: the TypeScript declarations derive a record's type
  (`RowOf`), an insert's (`InsertOf`, requiring each field neither nullable,
  defaulted nor generated), an update's (`UpdateOf`) and a key's (`KeyOf`)
  from the columns alone, an enum's listed values becoming a union of its
  labels. A class declared with decorators or static fields would need the
  types written twice, and Node.js runs TypeScript by stripping types, which
  decorators are not.
- **Columns** take a kind every result decodes as — any value kind but `u64`
  and `char` — or a schema-qualified `TypeName`, `CreatedRange` or
  `CreatedMultirange`, and the options `name`, `nullable`, `array`,
  `primaryKey` (each such column, in order, makes the key), `default`,
  `generated` (`"always"`, which no write sets, or `"byDefault"`) and an
  enum's `values`. A declaration that cannot be used throws a
  `ConstructionError` as it is made.
- **Records** are checked against the declaration as they decode: the
  result's columns are exactly the ones selected, each of its declared kind —
  an `int8` read into an `i32` field, or another schema's enum, is a
  `DecodeError` — with no NULL where the field is not nullable and no label an
  enum field does not list.
- **Reads**: `find()`, `select(..fields)`, `findByKey(key)`; `where`,
  `orderBy`, `limit`, `offset`, and `join(relation)` to filter on a related
  row; `all`, `one`, `optional`, `count` on a pool, connection or
  transaction, and `stream` on a pool or connection. `col(field)` compares
  through the field's kind — an enum's label binds cast to its type — and
  refuses `null`, which `isNull()` tests.
- **Writes**: a field left out stays out — the table's default on insert,
  the column unchanged on update — and one set to `null` writes NULL. An
  update or delete needs `where` or `allRows()`. `returning(..fields)` reads
  the rows written; `returningChange(s)` an update's rows before and after,
  and `returningUpsert(s)` whether an insert inserted each row or updated
  the one its conflict found, as pgorm's `exec_returning_change(s)` and
  `exec_returning_upsert(s)` read them.
- **Relations** (`belongsTo`, `hasOne`, `hasMany`) pair fields of two
  models. `relation.find(row)` reads the far end of a record and
  `relation.load(db, rows)` the far end of many in one query; a key nothing
  matches is a `DecodeError`, never a missing row.
- **Graphs**: `graph().joinOne(relation)` is an INNER JOIN decoded as a
  record, `joinMaybe` a LEFT JOIN decoded as a record or `null`, `via` a
  junction no record reads, each source projected under `s0_`, `s1_`, .. as
  pgorm's `SelectGraph` projects it; a row is the root's record alone, or a
  tuple of every source's. `alias` names a second table of one model, `from`
  the source a relation starts at, and `allGrouped` gathers a one-slot
  graph's records under each root.
- **Cursors and pages**: `cursor(..fields)` pages by keyset — `after`,
  `before`, `first`, `last`, `asc`, `desc`, and on a graph the slots'
  primary keys as tiebreaks, with `afterWith` resuming inside a run of one
  root — and `paginate(size)` by limit and offset, with `numItems`,
  `numPages` and `pages()`. `inspect("count")`, `inspect("returningChanges")`
  and the like show what a terminal sends.

## Schema

DDL is built from JavaScript as the statements are, through pgorm-query's DDL
builders, and runs through `execute`:

```js
import {
  alterTable, col, ColumnDef, createDomain, createIndex, createSchema, createSequence, createTable,
  createType, DataType, domainValue, Table, TypeName, Value,
} from "@necessary/pgorm";

const mood = new TypeName("mood", { schema: "app" });
const seats = new TypeName("seats", { schema: "app" });
const booking = new Table("booking", { schema: "app" });

await pool.execute(createSchema("app", { ifNotExists: true }));
await pool.execute(createType(mood).values(["calm", "tense"]));
await pool.execute(createDomain(seats, "smallint").default(1).check(domainValue().between(1, 12)));
await pool.execute(
  createTable(booking)
    .column(new ColumnDef("id", "bigint").identity("always", { startWith: 1000 }))
    .column(new ColumnDef("room", "integer").notNull({ name: "room_present" }))
    .column(new ColumnDef("seats", seats))
    .column(new ColumnDef("during", "tstzrange").notNull())
    .column(new ColumnDef("mood", mood).default(new Value("calm", mood)))
    .column(new ColumnDef("price", new DataType("numeric", { precision: 8, scale: 2 })).check(col("price").gte(0)))
    .primaryKey("id")
    .unique("room", { withoutOverlaps: "during", name: "no_double_booking" })
    .foreignKey("room", new Table("room", { schema: "app" }), "id", { onDelete: "cascade" }),
);
await pool.execute(alterTable(booking).addCheck(col("room").lt(500), { name: "small", notValid: true }));
await pool.execute(createIndex(booking, { on: "during", order: "desc" }).using("gist").where(col("room").gt(0)));
await pool.execute(createSequence("ticket").options({ incrementBy: 10, maxValue: null }));
```

- **A statement renders as it runs.** PostgreSQL takes no parameters in DDL,
  so a value a statement carries — a `DEFAULT`, a `CHECK`'s operands, an enum
  label, a comment — is written as pgorm-query's escaped literal, and
  `inspect()` gives `{ sql, values: [] }`. Names are identifiers, quoted.
  Nothing runs until a terminal runs it.
- **Schemas**: `createSchema(name, { ifNotExists })`, `dropSchema(names, {
  ifExists, behavior })` over one name or several, and `renameSchema(name,
  newName)`. A schema is named by one string, never a `Table`. A drop of a
  schema that holds anything is refused (`2BP01`) unless its behavior is
  `"cascade"`.
- **Tables**: `createTable(table)` with `column`, `primaryKey` (one; a later
  call replaces it), `unique`, `foreignKey` and `check`. A key takes `name`,
  `include`, `deferrability` and PostgreSQL 18's `withoutOverlaps` (its period
  column, written last); a unique key `nullsNotDistinct`. A foreign key pairs
  its columns with as many referenced ones and takes `onDelete`, `onUpdate`,
  `deferrability`, `enforcement` and PostgreSQL 18's `period: [column,
  referenced]`. A `ColumnDef` takes `notNull({ name, noInherit })`, `null`,
  `default`, `check`, `generated(expr, "stored" | "virtual")`,
  `identity("always" | "byDefault", sequenceOptions)`, `autoIncrement` and
  `collate`. `dropTable`, `renameTable`, `renameColumn`, `renameConstraint`
  and `truncateTable`; `commentOnTable` and `commentOnColumn`.
- **Alterations**: `alterTable(table)` has no action and so nothing to run;
  its first of `addColumn`, `modifyColumn`, `dropColumn`, `addPrimaryKey`,
  `addUnique`, `addForeignKey`, `addCheck`, `addNotNull`, `dropConstraint`,
  `validateConstraint`, `alterConstraint`, `setExpression` and
  `dropExpression` gives the statement, which takes more. `notValid` adds a
  foreign key, `CHECK` or `NOT NULL` without checking the rows already there,
  which `validateConstraint` checks later. A `modifyColumn` refuses what no
  `ALTER COLUMN` writes, a generated expression among it.
- **Indexes**: `createIndex(table, entry, { name })` over columns, expressions
  and `{ on, order, operatorClass }`, with `unique`, `nullsNotDistinct`,
  `ifNotExists`, `using(method)`, `include` and `where`; `dropIndex(table,
  name)`.
- **Types**: `createType(name)` — `.values(labels)` for an enumeration,
  `.attribute(name, type)` for a composite, `.asRange(subtype, { .. })` for a
  range — and `alterType(name)` with `addValue`, `renameTo`, `renameValue`,
  `renameAttribute` and a composite's `addAttribute`, `dropAttribute` and
  `alterAttribute`; `dropType`.
- **Domains**: `createDomain(name, base)` over any column type, with
  `collate`, `default`, `notNull` or `null` (one slot) and `check(condition,
  { name })`, a condition over `domainValue()`, PostgreSQL's `VALUE`.
  `alterDomain(name)` has no action and so nothing to run; one of
  `setDefault`, `dropDefault`, `setNotNull`, `dropNotNull`,
  `addCheck(condition, { name, notValid })`, `dropConstraint`,
  `renameConstraint`, `validateConstraint` and `renameTo` is the whole
  statement, PostgreSQL taking one action per `ALTER DOMAIN`. `dropDomain`
  over one name or several. A column of a domain is a `ColumnDef` typed
  with its `TypeName`.
- **Sequences and extensions**: `createSequence(name)` and
  `alterSequence(name)` with `asType`, `options({ incrementBy, minValue,
  maxValue, startWith, cache, cycle })` — the options an identity column
  takes, `null` a bound's `NO` form — `ownedBy` and, altering, `restart`;
  `dropSequence` and `renameSequence`; `createExtension` and `dropExtension`.
- **Views**: `createView(name, select)` with `orReplace`, `columns`,
  `checkOption("local" | "cascaded")`, `securityBarrier` and
  `securityInvoker`; `createRecursiveView(name, columns, select)`, which
  takes no check option; `createMaterializedView(name, select)` and
  `createTableAs(name, select)` with `ifNotExists`, `columns` and
  `withNoData`; `refreshMaterializedView(name, { concurrently, withNoData })`,
  never both; `dropView` and `dropMaterializedView`. A view's query is
  written with its values as literals, a definition binding nothing.
- An options object holding a key its builder does not know is a
  `TypeError`, so a misspelt option is never left out.

## Pipelines

pgorm's PRQL-shaped pipeline is the module's `pipeline` namespace:
relation-to-relation stages over sources, compiled through prqlc to
PostgreSQL SQL and run as any statement is.

```js
import { pipeline as pl, Table } from "@necessary/pgorm";

const items = new Table("items", { schema: "app" });
const category = pl.col("items", "category");
const amount = pl.col("items", "amount");
const total = pl.alias("total");

const minimum = 10;
const top = pl.from(items)
  .filterWith((binder) => amount.gt(binder.bind(minimum)))   // $1, minted by this stage's binder
  .group(category)
  .aggregate(pl.sum(amount).as(total))
  .filter(total.gt(100))                                      // $2: a value is bound, not written
  .sort(total.desc())
  .take(5);                                                   // LIMIT 5: a count is no expression

top.inspect();               // { sql: "SELECT category, COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) AS total ..", values: [..] }
await pool.query(top);
```

- **Stages**: `from(source)`, then `filter`, `derive`, `select`, `group(..)`
  and `aggregate(..)`, `window(over, ..)`, `sort`, `take`, `takeRange`,
  `join(source, on, { kind })`, `append`, `intersect`, `remove` and
  `distinct`, each returning a new pipeline. A source is a `Table` (read under
  its alias if it has one), a table's name, another pipeline — embedded whole,
  its bound values with it — or `pl.source(relation).named(name)`, which is
  how a relation meets itself.
- **Expressions** are the pipeline's own, not the statement builders':
  `pl.col(table, column)` (prqlc has no catalog, so columns are qualified),
  `pl.alias(name)` for a name a stage introduces, `pl.thisColumn` and
  `pl.thatColumn` for a join's sides, the comparison, logical and arithmetic
  methods, `coalesce`, `isNull`, `inArray`, `cast`, `as`, `asc`/`desc`,
  `pl.caseWhen`, the aggregates (`sum`, `min`, `max`, `average`, `stddev`,
  `count`, `countDistinct`, `countRows`) and the window functions
  (`rowNumber`, `rank`, `rankDense`, `lag`, `lead`, `first`, `last`) over
  `pl.over().by(..).sortBy(..).rows(start, end)`.
- **Values**: `pl.literal(v)` writes a value into the SQL; any other value an
  operand is given is bound, by the stage that takes it.
- **Binders**: each stage has a `With` form whose function is called once
  with a `Binder`; `bind(v)` mints one placeholder, reusable in the
  expressions the function returns. Like pgorm's lifetime-branded binder, it
  binds only while its function runs, and a placeholder anywhere but its own
  stage — a plain stage, another binder's, another pipeline, a window's keys —
  is a `LifecycleError`.
- **Terminals** are the pool's, connection's and transaction's, with their
  cardinality: `one` wants exactly one row, so ask for it with `.take(1)`.
  What prqlc cannot compile — an alias it reserves, a name it cannot write —
  is a `ConstructionError` before anything is sent.

## Registered entities

An application with pgorm entities in Rust registers them, and its graph
shapes, in a `Registry` and builds one native module carrying the binding's
API and its registrations, from a `#[neon::main]` of its own that calls
`pgorm_napi::install`. JavaScript then reaches each by name, and every
operation is the entity's own Rust API: `Select<E>` and its terminals,
`ActiveModelTrait`'s writes with the application's hooks, the terminals that
return a row's two versions, `SelectGraph` with its cursor, and pipelines
that read an entity's table and decode a registered source tuple's rows
through `select_sources`. The binding's own module registers nothing. [ENTITIES.md](ENTITIES.md) shows how to build
the module and use it; `node pgorm-napi/checks/entities.js` builds the
repository's application fixture and runs its suite in both runtimes.

```js
import { entity, graph } from "./lib/index.js";

const Account = entity("app.Account");
const busy = await Account.find().where(Account.col("mood").eq("busy")).all(pool);
const saved = await Account.active().set("id", 1).set("display name", "Ann").insert(pool);  // hooks run
const rows = await graph("app.AccountNotes").find({ aliases: ["n"] }).all(pool);        // [account, note | null][]
```

## Generated TypeScript

`pgorm-napi/codegen` builds an application's module from an
`application.json` naming its entity crate, entities, graphs and source tuples,
then writes a TypeScript module typing each registration from what the built
library describes: `AccountRecord` with each column's type, nullability and an
enum's labels, `AccountInput`, graph and source rows as tuples of records.
The generated module checks, as it loads, that the library is the one it was
written from. [CODEGEN.md](CODEGEN.md) has the workflow;
`node pgorm-napi/checks/codegen.js` runs it on the repository's fixture.

```sh
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js scaffold application.json --pgorm-source . --output app-module
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js build app-module
node pgorm-napi/codegen/cli.js emit app-module    # app-module/lib/app.js and app.d.ts
```

## Values

A parameter is bound, never interpolated, and each value has one JavaScript
type, both ways. Precision comes first: a value reaches JavaScript exactly or
not at all, and one that cannot is a `DecodeError` or `ConstructionError`,
never a rounded number, a truncated time or a string.

| PostgreSQL | JavaScript |
| --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `boolean` |
| `int2`, `int4`, `oid`, `"char"` | `number` |
| `int8` | `bigint`, never a number |
| `float4`, `float8` | `number` |
| `text`, `varchar`, `bpchar`, `name`, an enum | `string` |
| `bytea` | `Uint8Array` |
| `numeric` | `Decimal`, its text keeping its scale (`"19.9900"`) |
| `uuid` | `Uuid` |
| `json`, `jsonb` | JSON values; an integer past 2^53 − 1 as a `bigint` |
| `date`, `time`, `timestamp` | `Temporal.PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime` |
| `timestamptz` | `Temporal.Instant` |
| `interval` | `Interval`: months, days and microseconds, each signed |
| `inet`, `cidr`; `macaddr` | `string`; six-byte `Uint8Array` |
| arrays | arrays, `null` for a NULL item |
| ranges and multiranges | `Range`, `Multirange` |
| NULL | `null` |

Why these:

- **`numeric`** is a `Decimal`, not a number, because a float cannot hold
  `0.1` or `19.9900`. It is exact within pgorm's range (a 96-bit coefficient,
  28 fractional digits), is made from a string or a `bigint`, and refuses to
  become a number implicitly.
- **Dates and times** are Temporal's, not `Date`: a `Date` holds milliseconds
  and one meaning, an instant, where PostgreSQL has microseconds and four
  types. A `timestamptz` is an instant — PostgreSQL stores no zone with it, and
  the binary protocol sends UTC microseconds — so it reads as a
  `Temporal.Instant`, the same whatever the session's `TimeZone`, which only
  shapes its text. A `ZonedDateTime` or a `Date` parameter is refused rather
  than have its zone dropped or its meaning guessed, and a `PlainDateTime`
  binds only to `timestamp` and an `Instant` only to `timestamptz`. A value
  with a digit below the microsecond is refused; round it first, e.g.
  `instant.round({ smallestUnit: "microsecond" })`.
- **`interval`** is the module's `Interval` rather than a `Temporal.Duration`,
  whose fields must share one sign and so cannot hold `1 mon -2 days`.
  `Interval.from(duration)` and `interval.toDuration()` convert where they can.
- **`timetz`** is refused: no Temporal type is a time of day at a fixed offset.
  Select it cast to `time` or `text`.

A plain parameter's kind is inferred where its JavaScript type leaves one
answer: a safe-integer `number` binds as an integer, any other number as a
`float8`, a `bigint` as `int8`, a plain object as JSON, an array as an array of
its items' one kind. For anything else, declare the kind with `Value`, using
pgorm-python's kind names:

```js
import { Range, TypeName, Value } from "@necessary/pgorm";

new Value(5, "i16");                                  // an int2
Value.null("uuid");                                   // a typed NULL
Value.json(null);                                     // JSON's null, not SQL NULL
Value.array("i64", []);                               // an empty int8[]
new Value(new Range(1, 5), "int4range");              // a range's kind is never inferred
new Value("calm", new TypeName("mood", { schema: "app" }));
```

`{ tagged: true }` gives each column as a `Value`
carrying its kind, which tells an `int2` from an `int8` and SQL NULL from JSON's
`null`. A range type a schema created is a `CreatedRange` kind; its value
travels as text for the statement to cast, `CAST($1::text AS app.floatrange)`,
as pgorm's own `DeriveCreatedRange` does.

## Errors

Every failure rejects with a subclass of `PgormError`: `DatabaseError` when
PostgreSQL refuses a statement, with its `sqlstate`, `severity` and optional
diagnostic fields (`detail`, `hint`, `schema`, `table`, `column`, `datatype`,
`constraint`); `ConnectionError` when the server cannot be reached;
`ConstructionError` for an argument pgorm cannot send; `DecodeError` for a
result that does not decode; `LifecycleError` for a handle used after it
closed or while another operation holds it; `TimeoutError` when no connection
frees up in time. Credentials never appear in a message.

A constraint violation rejects with a subclass of `DatabaseError` named for
it: `UniqueViolationError` (`23505`), `ForeignKeyViolationError` (`23503`),
`CheckViolationError` (`23514`), `NotNullViolationError` (`23502`) and
`ExclusionViolationError` (`23P01`, which a `WITHOUT OVERLAPS` key raises
too). A table's constraint is named in `constraint`, a `NOT NULL` column in
`column`, and a domain whose `CHECK` or `NOT NULL` refused the value in
`datatype`.

## Tests

One suite, written against `node:test` and `node:assert`, runs unchanged in
both runtimes against a live server. It reads `PGORM_TEST_DSN`, or else the
server `DATABASE_URL` names (from the environment or the checkout's
`.env.local`/`.env`, as the Rust suite does) and its `postgres` database.

```sh
cd pgorm-napi
node --test "tests/*.test.ts"
deno test --allow-ffi --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run tests/
deno check
```

`tests/exit.test.ts` runs each of `tests/fixtures/` in a fresh process of the
runtime under test, which is why Deno's suite needs `--allow-run`, and holds it
to exiting by itself. `tests/runtime.test.ts` drives a panic on the runtime and
Neon's drop queue through two exports only debug builds carry, skipped against
a release build. `tests/values.test.ts`, `tests/connections.test.ts`, `tests/statements.test.ts`
and the other live files each make a database of their own, named for the
runtime and process, and drop it when they end.
`tests/statements-parity.test.ts` holds each statement family's cases under
`tests/parity/` to the golden file beside them, which the addon's Rust unit
tests build the same statements to with pgorm-query directly. The suite
connects in plaintext unless its connection string names an `sslmode`; with
`PGORM_TEST_CA` naming a PEM CA whose certificate for `localhost` the server
presents, it also holds verified TLS to that CA, as CI does. `deno.json` keeps
Deno on its global npm cache, so type checking `node:` imports needs no
`node_modules`.

`tests/package/` is the installed packages' smoke suite. It imports
`@necessary/pgorm` by name and runs only in the projects `checks/package.js`
installs the packed packages into ([DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md#build-and-verify)),
so `deno test` leaves it out here, while `deno check` holds it to the
declarations through the package's own name.

`tests/models.test.ts` and `tests/graphs.test.ts` make their databases
through `tests/model-fixtures.ts`. `tests/models-parity.test.ts` holds the
models' statements to `tests/parity/models.json`, which the Rust test
`models::parity` builds with pgorm's own entities — `find`, `Insert`,
`Update::many`, `Delete::many` and `SelectGraph` — and, where pgorm composes a
statement inside a terminal, with pgorm-query as the terminal does.
`tests/model-types.test.ts` is held by `deno check`: it type-checks only while
the declarations type a model's records, writes, keys, graphs and cursors from
its columns, and refuse what the binding refuses.
