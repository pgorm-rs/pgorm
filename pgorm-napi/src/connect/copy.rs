//! COPY's data flow — `COPY … FROM STDIN` and `COPY … TO STDOUT` through
//! pgorm's `CopyTrait` — on a pool's connection, a connection, or a
//! transaction or savepoint.
//!
//! The sink and the stream `CopyTrait` returns borrow their connection or
//! transaction exclusively, so neither can sit in a JavaScript handle beside
//! what it borrows. A session task on the runtime owns the connection — or, in
//! a transaction, the frame's task runs the session itself, holding the
//! frame's lock — and drives the COPY, and JavaScript's handle reaches it over
//! channels: data in, a byte budget bounding what is queued and not yet
//! accepted, and one pull at a time out.
//!
//! The session ends with the connection kept or discarded. Every outcome
//! PostgreSQL reported — a row refused at `finish`, a query that failed part
//! way, a COPY abandoned with `CopyFail` because its source failed — leaves
//! the connection at a known point and keeps it. An abort, the connection,
//! pool or transaction closing, a COPY TO left unread, and a COPY FROM the
//! server refused before its data flow started, after which pgorm closes the
//! connection, discard it. Each JavaScript call that ends a session settles
//! only once the session has released what it ran on, so the next operation
//! on the connection or transaction finds it free.
