//! Transactions and savepoints. pgorm opens a transaction only around a
//! closure, whose `DatabaseTransaction` borrows its connection, and a
//! savepoint's its parent, exclusively; that borrow cannot cross into
//! JavaScript, so a task on the runtime serves each frame's commands inside
//! its closure, nested savepoint frames inside their parent's, and
//! JavaScript's handles send it owned commands. While a savepoint is open its
//! parent's frame is suspended inside it, holding the parent's lock: the
//! parent refuses a statement, a commit, a rollback or another savepoint until
//! the child finishes, and refuses a second request while one runs, rather
//! than queue or race it.
