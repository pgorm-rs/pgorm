//! pgorm's PRQL-shaped pipeline, from JavaScript.
//!
//! A JavaScript pipeline owns a `pgorm::pipeline::Pipeline`, and every stage
//! returns a new one from a copy. Expressions are recipes (`recipe`) lowered
//! as a stage takes them, inside the binder closure of the stage's `_with`
//! form whenever they bind a value, so that every value enters through
//! pgorm's binder and no placeholder outlives its stage (`scope`).
