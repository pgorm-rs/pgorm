//! Compile-time query validation for pgorm's raw-SQL escape hatches.
//!
//! Two function-like macros live here: [`sql!`] holds a raw SQL string
//! literal to the PostgreSQL grammar, and [`prql!`] compiles a PRQL string
//! literal down to PostgreSQL SQL with its placeholder arity checked against
//! the arguments given. The crate is a sibling of `pgorm-macros` rather than
//! more macros inside it because the entity derives have no use for either
//! the libpg_query oracle or the PRQL compiler.

/// but the final SQL they land in is still validated.
