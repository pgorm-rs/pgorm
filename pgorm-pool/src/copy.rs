/// Start `COPY … FROM STDIN` through `start`, closing the connection behind
/// `connection` if it does not start.
///
/// tokio-postgres sends `Bind`, `Execute` and `Sync` together, and a `Sync`
/// again when the sink it returns is finished or dropped. Once the server is
/// in copy-in mode it ignores the first `Sync`, so a COPY that starts is
/// answered by one `ReadyForQuery`. A COPY the server refuses before entering
/// copy-in mode — an undefined table or column, an option it rejects, a
/// transaction already aborted — answers the first `Sync` with a
/// `ReadyForQuery` that ends the request, and then answers the second with
/// another that no request is waiting for. tokio-postgres hands that one to
/// the next request, which reads it as its own answer and leaves its own
/// answer to the request after it: every later response on the connection is
/// read by the wrong request. Nothing in its public API sends a message the
/// server does not answer, so the extra one cannot be absorbed; the connection
/// is closed instead, every later call on it fails as closed, and the pool's
/// recycling discards it. A cancelled start closes it too, since whether the
/// server refused is then unknown.
// [spec:pgorm:req:conn.copy+1]    a refused start closes the connection
