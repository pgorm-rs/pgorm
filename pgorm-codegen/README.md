# pgorm-codegen

Entity source generation for pgorm. Give it a schema as DDL text and it
writes the entity modules: models, columns, primary keys, relations, and
active enums. The text is read with
[libpg_query](https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query), the PostgreSQL
server's own parser, so it is read as PostgreSQL 18 reads it. Library-only;
there is no CLI. Call it from a build script or a small binary of your own.

`entities_from_sql` is the whole pipeline. It returns a `WriterOutput`, whose
`files` are `OutputFile`s holding a name and its source, for you to write;
`EntityWriterOptions` chooses what is generated:

```rust,no_run
use pgorm_codegen::{EntityWriterOptions, WithSerde, entities_from_sql};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ddl = std::fs::read_to_string("schema.sql")?;
    let output = entities_from_sql(
        &ddl,
        EntityWriterOptions {
            with_serde: WithSerde::Both,
            ..Default::default()
        },
    )?;
    for file in output.files {
        std::fs::write(format!("src/entities/{}", file.name), file.content)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

The schema is the `CREATE` statements: tables with their keys and foreign
keys, enum and range types, domains, indexes, comments and schemas. Anything
else in the text is refused with an `Error` naming it, so a schema that
generates is one read in full. `pg_dump --schema-only` writes its keys as
`ALTER TABLE` statements and opens with `SET`s, so its output is refused.

The stages are public too: `parse_schema` reads the text into the
`TableCreateStatement`s `EntityTransformer::transform` takes, and
`EntityWriter::generate` writes the entities, so statements built in code
generate the same way.
