/// COPY's data flow: `COPY … FROM STDIN` and `COPY … TO STDOUT` on a
/// connection or a transaction.
///
/// A COPY's rows travel as `CopyData` messages beside the statement rather
/// than as a statement's parameters or result, so [`ConnectionTrait`] has no
/// route to them. These two methods are that route, over the typed statements
/// pgorm-query builds: the table and column names are quoted, the format is
/// one of PostgreSQL's three, and a statement that is not a COPY — which the
/// driver would run to completion before noticing it opened no data flow —
/// cannot be passed at all.
///
/// Both borrow the connection exclusively for as long as the sink or stream
/// they return is alive. A COPY in progress holds the connection's request
/// queue, so a second statement sent meanwhile would wait behind data the
/// caller had not yet sent or read; and a transaction committed while its COPY
/// is open would wait the same way. The borrow makes both a compile error:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0499
/// # use pgorm::{CopyTrait, ConnectionTrait, DatabaseConnection, Error};
/// # use pgorm::pgorm_query::{CopyFromStatement, CopyText, Name};
/// async fn interleave(db: &mut DatabaseConnection) -> Result<(), Error> {
