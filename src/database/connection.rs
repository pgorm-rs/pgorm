/// What a [`ConnectionTrait`] statement is: SQL text, and nothing else.
///
/// The trait is sealed and implemented for exactly `str` and `String`, so those
/// two spellings are the whole of what the statement methods accept. What it
/// excludes is the point. tokio-postgres bounds its own statement surface on
/// `ToStatement`, which additionally admits an already-prepared `Statement` —
/// and a `Statement` names a statement that exists on the one connection it was
/// prepared against, so handing it to another connection compiles and then
/// fails on the wire with SQLSTATE `26000`, *prepared statement does not exist*.
/// Bounding on this trait instead deletes that call rather than diagnosing it.
///
/// Because text is all a statement can be, [`sql_text`](SqlText::sql_text)
/// always has an answer. The two readers of it — the statement cache
/// (`conn.pool.conn-trait`) and the metrics fingerprint (`metric.fingerprint`)
/// — are therefore total: neither has a case where the SQL it is looking at has
/// gone missing.
