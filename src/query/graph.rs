//! The N-ary relational read: a root entity plus a typed list of joined,
//! decoded sources.
//!
//! [`SelectGraph<E, S>`] is one shape at every arity where the pair surface
//! had a bespoke type per pair. The declaration is the whole contract:
//!
//! - the *slot kind is the join type is the decode shape* — [`Opt<F>`] is a
//!   `LEFT JOIN` decoded through the absence witness as `Option<F::Model>`,
//!   [`Req<F>`] is an `INNER JOIN` decoded as a bare `F::Model` — so
//!   "LEFT-joined but decoded as required" is unrepresentable;
//! - the projection is *generated only*, by the one writer
//!   ([`project_source`], prefix `s{i}_`, the `select_as` enum-cast
//!   discipline included), and the builder implements no [`QuerySelect`], so
//!   a hand-edited projection that the decode does not expect cannot be
//!   written;
//! - the decode target is `(E::Model, S1::Out, …, Sn::Out)`, computed from
//!   the declared slot tuple, so a mismatch is a type error rather than a
//!   run-time surprise.
