//! The post-compilation parameter census: what the emitted SQL still asks
//! for, and the values compacted to match.
//!
//! The binder mints a `$N` for every bound value, but prqlc's optimizer may
//! prune an expression nothing reads — a derived column a later `select`
//! drops — and the placeholder vanishes with it while the value stays. The
//! server refuses that mismatch at bind time, so [`prune`] re-counts the
//! placeholders the emitted SQL actually carries, discards the orphaned
//! values and renumbers the survivors contiguously, rewriting the SQL and
//! compacting the values in one pass.
//!
//! The count is a lexer census, not a text scan: `pg_query::scan` — the
//! PostgreSQL lexer pgorm already links — hands back `PARAM` tokens with
//! byte extents, so a `$1` sitting inside a string literal
//! (`filter(note.eq("costs $1"))` renders as `'costs $1'`) is never
//! miscounted, and the extents are exactly what the rewrite needs. Reading
//! the finished SQL is complete here where it has to be defended in `prql!`
//! ([spec:pgorm:sem:macros.prql.census]): the pipeline has no s-strings
//! ([spec:pgorm:req:pipeline.surface+3] cuts them), so every placeholder in
//! the emitted text is a `Param` node the binder minted, and the census can
//! only ever find a subset of the minted numbers — never a foreign `$N`
//! with no value behind it.
