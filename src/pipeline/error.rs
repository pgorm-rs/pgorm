    ///   SQL. Doubling it here would only move the ambiguity: the fork would
    ///   double it a second time.
    /// - NUL, which PostgreSQL carries in no identifier under any quoting.

    ///   `[a-z_$][a-z0-9_$]*` and is not a keyword, a pattern that predates

    ///   dollar-quote delimiter, so two such names swallow the SQL between

    ///   quoting is decided, so no spelling of it reaches the SQL as a name.
