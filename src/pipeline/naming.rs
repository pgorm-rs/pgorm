//! Making a projection addressable, so a deduplication can key on all of it.
//!
//! prqlc resolves `this` — the whole-relation reference
//! [`distinct`](super::Pipeline::distinct) deduplicates on — by walking a
//! namespace keyed by name. Two ordinary projections have columns that
//! namespace cannot hold: an expression left unnamed is filed nowhere at all,
//! and of two columns competing for one name only the last is filed. Either
//! way the column is missing from the deduplication key *and* from the
//! result, because the key is what the deduplicated relation projects.
//!
//! Naming is what makes a column addressable, so this module decides which
//! items need a name of their own and what to call them — and, because a
//! settled relation answers to bare names alone, how a sort key follows the
//! column it names across that boundary.
