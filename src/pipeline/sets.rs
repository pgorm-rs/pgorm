//! What SQL's set-operation precedence costs a flat rendering.
//!
//! A pipeline writes set operations left to right, so
//! `append(b).intersect(c)` means `(a ∪ b) ∩ c`. Rendered flat — one
//! `SELECT` per operand with the operators between them, which is what prqlc
//! emits when nothing forces a subquery — that reaches PostgreSQL as
//! `a UNION ALL b INTERSECT ALL c`, and PostgreSQL binds `INTERSECT` tighter
//! than `UNION` and `EXCEPT`. The server evaluates `a ∪ (b ∩ c)`: a different
//! relation, and for a self-combining source every row twice.
//!
//! Parentheses are not available — prqlc owns the rendering — but a binding
//! is: a `let`-bound subrelation is a CTE the next operation reads as one
//! whole relation, which is the same bracket by another spelling. This module
//! is the knowledge of *when* that bracket is owed, and nothing else.
