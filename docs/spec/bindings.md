# Language bindings

pgorm has two language bindings. pgorm-python is a Python package over a
native PyO3 extension. pgorm-napi is a JavaScript module over a native
Node-API addon, which Node.js and Deno both load. This chapter states what
both bindings offer. It is written once, and both bindings' code and tests
answer to it.

[python.md](python.md) and [napi.md](napi.md) keep only what differs by
language: how names are spelled, how asynchronous work is awaited and closed,
which native types carry values, typing, packaging and runtimes. Where the two
bindings made different choices that the operator has not yet settled, each
binding's current behaviour stays in its own chapter until it is.

A shared rule writes a name once, in a neutral spelling: snake_case for
functions, methods and options, PascalCase for classes. Each binding spells
the name by its own naming rule (`python.naming`, `napi.naming`), which also
lists the names that differ beyond that rule. A closed choice, such as a join
kind, is named in plain words; each binding spells its members by its naming
rule. A Python keyword argument and a JavaScript options object are the same
option.

## Package boundary

> [spec:pgorm:def:bindings.api]
> A language binding is a package for one language, backed by a native
> extension over pgorm's Rust query construction, execution and decoding APIs.
> It offers runtime builders for statements, expressions, schema and
> pipelines; models an application declares over its own tables; and
> registrations, through which a Rust application exposes its compiled
> entities and graph shapes. A program composes operations and values at run
> time, within what the installed build offers.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.optional]
> Each binding MUST live in an opt-in companion crate. Ordinary pgorm builds,
> default workspace builds and Rust library users MUST NOT need the binding's
> language, its runtimes, its native-extension framework or its linker
> configuration. Building a binding MUST be explicit. Its public artifacts
> MUST exclude test fixtures, deliberately vulnerable controls and
> campaign-only dependencies.
>
> Each companion crate is its own Cargo workspace, which keeps its
> configuration out of ordinary Rust builds. Cargo reads a `patch` table only
> from a workspace's root, so a revision pgorm pins MUST reach the companion
> crate through pgorm's own dependency declarations, which travel with pgorm
> into every workspace that depends on it, and never through a `patch` table.
> The crate's committed lockfile MUST resolve each pinned dependency to the
> pinned revision. A divergence is silent: the binding would link the unpinned
> crate and behave differently from the library every pgorm test exercises,
> and for a compiler dependency it would write SQL the Rust API does not. So a
> divergence MUST fail a check in this repository.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.delegation]
> Each operation a binding exposes MUST invoke its corresponding Rust API in
> the language's process, through the native extension. Building and running
> a query MUST NOT need an HTTP adapter, an RPC service or a subprocess that
> dispatches queries. A program composes builder operations directly; choosing
> a fixed query handler and handing it inputs does not meet this rule.
>
> A binding MUST NOT implement a second SQL renderer, escaping algorithm,
> placeholder substitution or query optimizer. Every convenience lowers into a
> documented Rust operation. A dynamic statement path MUST NOT be presented as
> an `EntityTrait`, ActiveModel or typed graph path. A query composed at run
> time MUST NOT invoke rustc, Cargo, a packaging tool or a code-generation
> build.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.surface]
> The two bindings MUST offer the same public operations, each spelled by its
> binding's naming rule. `docs/spec/bindings-surface.json` declares the shared
> surface once, in neutral spelling: each module's functions, classes and
> constants, and each class's methods. Beside it, the file lists:
>
> - the names one binding offers alone, each with the language reason it has
>   no counterpart;
> - the shared names one binding still lacks, each with the plan node that
>   adds it;
> - the differences that wait on the operator's decision.
>
> Each binding's own test suite MUST read its live module — its exports, its
> classes and their methods — and fail when the module offers a name the file
> does not list for that binding, when it lacks a shared name that is not
> listed as a gap, or when a name listed as a gap is present. A class's data
> fields are outside this check; the rules that state them are tested by each
> binding's own suites.

## Runtime and errors

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.runtime]
> Each binding MUST run pgorm's asynchronous work on one multi-threaded Tokio
> runtime per process, built on first use and reused by every pool and every
> operation after it. A runtime, a pool or a native build MUST NOT be created
> per call or per query. The language's own thread MUST NOT block waiting on
> the runtime: an operation that does I/O is awaited in the language's own
> asynchronous form (`python.runtime`, `napi.promises`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.errors+3]
> Each binding MUST report a failure as an instance of its own error classes,
> all derived from one base class of the binding and from the language's own
> base error:
>
> - `DatabaseError` when PostgreSQL reports an error, carrying its SQLSTATE as
>   `sqlstate`, its severity and message, and the diagnostic fields `detail`,
>   `hint`, `schema`, `table`, `column`, `datatype` and `constraint`, each text
>   or null;
> - for a constraint violation pgorm's `SqlError` classifies
>   (`error.model.sql-class`), the subclass of `DatabaseError` named for it:
>   `UniqueViolationError` (`23505`), `ForeignKeyViolationError` (`23503`),
>   `CheckViolationError` (`23514`), `NotNullViolationError` (`23502`) or
>   `ExclusionViolationError` (`23P01`), with the same fields, so the names the
>   server reported (a domain's in `datatype`) are read as from any other
>   `DatabaseError`;
> - `ConnectionError` when the server cannot be reached or the connection
>   breaks;
> - `ConstructionError` for an argument whose value cannot become what pgorm
>   sends;
> - `DecodeError` for a result that cannot become the native value asked for,
>   a wrong row count among them (`bindings.row-count`);
> - `LifecycleError` for a pool, connection, transaction, stream or listener
>   used after it closed, or while another operation holds it;
> - `TimeoutError` when no connection becomes free within a pool's acquire
>   timeout;
> - `InternalError` when pgorm or the binding fails in a way no input should
>   cause, a panic above all.
>
> An argument a call cannot use is refused before anything is sent, with the
> class `bindings.argument-errors` names. A cancelled operation is reported in
> the language's own way (`python.cancellation`, `napi.cancellation`). An error
> from PostgreSQL anywhere in a failure's cause chain makes the failure a
> `DatabaseError`, so a refusal during connection carries its SQLSTATE too.
> Credentials MUST NOT appear in an error, a nested cause, a representation
> or a default diagnostic log. Invalid input MUST NOT end the process, be
> swallowed, or become an ordinary result.
> A caught panic MUST stay an identifiable `InternalError`: it MUST NOT leave
> an operation pending, and MUST NOT be classified as an expected rejection of
> input.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.argument-errors+1]
> An argument of a type the call does not take MUST be refused with the
> language's `TypeError`, before anything is sent; a `ConstructionError`
> (`bindings.errors`) is left to an argument whose value cannot become what
> pgorm sends. Where a rule refuses an argument's other values with a
> `ConstructionError`, an argument of another type is a `TypeError` all the
> same. A `TypeError` is:
>
> - text that is not the language's string — an identifier, a type's,
>   function's, field's or qualifier's name, a JSON path, a LIKE pattern or
>   escape, a channel, a payload, a connection string, a COPY option — a flag
>   that is not a boolean, a count, size, offset or sampling argument that is
>   not a number (Python's `int` where a whole one is taken), a list that is
>   not the language's list, a pair of the wrong length, and a value kind that
>   is no kind name, `TypeName`, `CreatedRange` or `CreatedMultirange`;
> - a value outside a closed choice, whose type is the choice: a class whose
>   members are the choice, or a string that is one of its spellings, the
>   union of their literals (`Literal[..]` in Python's typing) — a join kind,
>   a lock strength, a frame's mode, start, end or exclusion, a NULLS
>   placement, an SQL/JSON behaviour, a generated or identity mode, a
>   deferrability, an enforcement, a foreign key's action, a behavior, a
>   constraint's change, a transaction's mode or isolation level, a COPY
>   format or log verbosity, the TLS mode, the recycling method, a sequence's
>   type, an index entry's order, a view's check option and the rest;
> - an option the call does not know — a keyword argument in Python, a key of
>   the options object in JavaScript — so a misspelt option is never left out;
> - a builder, or a plain value, where the call takes a builder of another
>   class: a `Select`; an expression where only an expression goes (a
>   projection, a grouping item, a RETURNING item, a table function's call, a
>   CHECK, a side of AND and OR); an expression or a `Condition` where a
>   predicate goes; an ordering; a `Window` or `ExtendedWindow`, a WINDOW
>   entry and OVER's window among them; a frame; a `Table` or FROM item; a
>   WITH clause; a MERGE action; a conflict action; a `ColumnDef`; a
>   `DataType`; a `TypeName` where a type is named; a model's column
>   declaration; and a receiver of another class, a handle only the binding
>   makes among them;
> - a builder no terminal runs given to one, a COPY given to any terminal but
>   `copy_in` and `copy_out`, and a COPY of another direction or format given
>   to `copy_in`, `copy_out`, `copy_in_rows` or `copy_out_rows`;
> - a statement in a form the binding's raw rule does not take (`python.raw`,
>   `napi.raw`): Python's SQL text outside a `RawSQL`, and JavaScript's
>   parameter list beside a built statement; a COPY source that is text or no
>   iterable, a chunk it yields that is not bytes, rows that are text or
>   bytes, and a row that is no sequence; and a binder function that returns
>   an awaitable or anything but an operand or a list of them.
>
> A value has no wrong type. A parameter, an operand, a `Value`'s data, the
> data the binding's value classes are made from, a model field's value, a
> COPY row's field and a JSON document may each be any value of the
> language, and one that cannot become what pgorm sends is a
> `ConstructionError`: a builder that is no expression given as an operand,
> and `any(..)` and `all(..)` where no operator takes one
> (`bindings.quantifiers`), among them. So is a name
> pgorm has nothing for — a function, a value kind, a built-in type, a
> pipeline cast, a registration, a field or a column — an identifier outside
> 1–63 bytes, a count or size out of range, an integer outside `bigint`, an
> empty list where one is needed, an expression where a table function takes
> a call, a pending statement or a `ColumnDef` given to a terminal
> (`bindings.schema`, `bindings.merge`), and a statement PostgreSQL would
> refuse.
>
> A listener's capacity is the one argument a value of the right type can
> take out of range with nothing pgorm sends to refuse it: a capacity of the
> type the language counts in that is not a positive whole number is the
> language's own class for a value out of range, Python's `ValueError` and
> JavaScript's `RangeError`.

## Values

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.values]
> Every kind of pgorm `Value` MUST cross into and out of each language as the
> one native type its binding declares for that kind (`python.values`,
> `napi.values`), and SQL NULL as the language's null, both ways. The kinds
> are named alike in both bindings: `bool`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u32`,
> `u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `text`, `char`, `bytes`, `json`, `decimal`, `uuid`,
> `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `datetime_utc`, `interval`, `ipnetwork`,
> `mac_address`, `vector`, PostgreSQL's six built-in range types and their
> multiranges by type name (`int4range` … `tstzmultirange`), an enum by its
> `TypeName`, and a range type a schema created by its `CreatedRange` or
> `CreatedMultirange` (`bindings.created-ranges`).
>
> A value MUST reach the language exactly or not at all. A value with no exact
> native form MUST be a `DecodeError`, never a rounded value, a string, a null
> or a missing column: a `numeric` outside pgorm's range of a 96-bit
> coefficient and 28 fractional digits, `NaN` or infinite; a date or timestamp
> outside the years pgorm holds, or infinite; the time `24:00`; a `timetz`; an
> array of more than one dimension, or one not starting at 1; and a type no
> kind covers. A domain decodes as the type it is built over.
>
> In the other direction a value MUST become the pgorm value it declares, or
> be refused with a `ConstructionError`: an integer outside its kind's range,
> a float its kind cannot hold without change, a decimal outside pgorm's range,
> a value of an unsupported type, an ambiguous value with no declared kind,
> and statement text holding NUL. A value MUST NOT silently become text, wrap,
> truncate or become NULL. A decimal MUST NOT pass through a float.
>
> Parameters are bound, never interpolated, through pgorm's `ValueHolder`,
> which writes each against the type PostgreSQL inferred for its placeholder
> and refuses a value that type cannot receive. Its coercions — an integer to
> any numeric type, a float to `float4` rounding as PostgreSQL's own cast
> does — are pgorm's, and a refusal names the parameter and the codec's
> reason.
>
> An interval is the binding's `Interval`: PostgreSQL's three independently
> signed fields, months, days and microseconds, each an exact integer within
> its width (`sql.value.interval`). It is immutable, is inferred as the
> `interval` kind and decodes from an `interval` column. A range or
> multirange value is the binding's `Range` or `Multirange`; a side with no
> bound is the language's null, and the empty range is `Range.empty()`. A
> range's kind is never inferred: a range operand or parameter needs the
> `Value` that declares its kind.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.value-tags]
> Each binding's `Value` MUST declare what a plain native value cannot: the
> kind of a value, so integer widths, enum types and temporal variants stay
> distinct; SQL NULL of a kind, `Value.null(kind)`; a JSON document,
> `Value.json(data)`, so JSON's `null` stays apart from SQL NULL; and an array
> of a named element kind, `Value.array(kind, items)`, which keeps its kind
> when it is empty or NULL. `Value(data, kind)` takes a kind by its name, a
> `TypeName` for an enum, or a `CreatedRange` or `CreatedMultirange`.
> Construction does no I/O and MUST convert at once, refusing data the kind
> cannot hold exactly with a `ConstructionError`. A `Value` is immutable, can
> be bound any number of times, and the plain value it hands out is owned
> independently.
>
> A result read tagged MUST give each column as a `Value` carrying its kind:
> an integer's width, an enum's schema-qualified type, an array's element kind,
> and SQL NULL apart from JSON's null.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.created-ranges]
> A created range's kind MUST carry the type's name, quoted and
> schema-qualifiable, and its subtype, one of the twelve pgorm's
> `RangeSubtype` admits, which converts each bound with that kind's limits
> (`sql.value.created-range`). Its value is the text form a
> `DeriveCreatedRange` newtype converts into, bound as text for the statement
> to cast, `CAST($1::text AS name)`, as `Expr::as_range` writes it. A result
> column of one MUST decode, through its subtype's binary codec, to a `Range`
> whose kind is named as the column's type is, whatever its subtype, so the
> value writes back to its column.
>
> A created multirange's kind is a `CreatedMultirange`, and its value is
> bound the same way. The driver reports a query's result column of one with
> no subtype, so reading that column MUST be a `DecodeError`, leaving it to be
> read cast to text. A binary COPY's column of one is described with its
> subtype, which pgorm completes from the catalogue (`conn.copy.rows`), so
> `copy_out_rows` MUST decode it through the subtype's codec to a
> `Multirange`, and `copy_in_rows` MUST write one back from a `Value` of its
> kind or from its text form. An array of a created range or multirange MUST
> be refused both ways, in a COPY as anywhere else.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.rows]
> A result's rows MUST be decoded on the runtime and reach the language one
> record per row, each keyed by column name in column order and each value
> the one `bindings.values` declares. Two columns of one name MUST be a
> `DecodeError`, not one key for both. A statement that returns no rows
> yields an empty list.

## Connections

A pool holds the connections; a `Connection` is one of them checked out; a
`Transaction` is a transaction or a savepoint on one; and a stream pulls a
statement's rows over one. Each is a native handle that is released by being
closed, and a transaction by the block or callback it was opened for ending.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.connections+2]
> A `Pool` MUST be built from a connection string and options: a TLS mode, CA
> certificates as PEM data, a maximum size, connect and acquire timeouts, a
> statement-cache size, a recycling method and a statement-cache channel.
> Building one sends nothing, and a string or an option value the pool
> cannot use is a `ConstructionError`; `connect` returns a pool whose server
> answered. TLS MUST default to verifying the server's certificate and host
> name against the CA given or the platform's trust store, with no silent
> fallback to plaintext. Only `sslmode=disable` in the string or the
> `disable` TLS mode connects in plaintext.
>
> A pool lends a `Connection` with `acquire`, and runs a statement of its own
> on a connection lent to it alone. Acquiring past the acquire timeout MUST
> fail with a `TimeoutError`. A connection runs one operation at a time: a
> second one, or any while a transaction or stream holds it, MUST be refused
> with a `LifecycleError` rather than queued or raced, as is any use after
> close. `status()` reports the pool's maximum size, its size, the
> connections available and the callers waiting.
>
> `clear_statement_caches()` MUST mark every connection's cached statements
> stale, as `conn.pool.statement-cache.clear` describes. It is synchronous,
> sends nothing, returns nothing, and is refused by no state of the pool. The
> `statement_cache_channel` option, absent by default, names a channel the
> pool listens on, clearing on every notification there as
> `conn.pool.statement-cache.listen` describes; an empty name or one longer
> than 63 bytes is a `ConstructionError`, and closing the pool closes the
> listening connection. `STATEMENT_CACHE_CHANNEL`, which each binding
> exports, is the channel pgorm-migration's runner notifies.
>
> Each pool, connection and stream MUST be closable explicitly, and in the
> language's scoped form (`python.lifecycle`, `napi.lifecycle`). What each
> holds MUST be released by that close, never left to garbage collection:
> closing a connection returns it to its pool at once, and closing a pool
> refuses new work, interrupts what runs and finishes once every connection
> is released. Connections live on the runtime and hold nothing the
> language's event loop waits on.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.results+2]
> A pool, a connection and a transaction MUST run a statement through pgorm's
> cached `ConnectionTrait` path with the same four terminals. `execute` gives
> the affected-row count as an exact integer; `query` gives every row; `one`
> gives exactly one row; and `optional` gives at most one, or null. A
> statement is a built statement (`bindings.statements`), a pipeline
> (`bindings.pipeline`), or raw SQL with its values (`python.raw`,
> `napi.raw`). Any other row count is a `DecodeError` (`bindings.row-count`).
> A database or decode error MUST NOT become an empty result, a null or a
> missing row. Decoding uses the documented Rust decode path.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.row-count]
> `one` finding no row or several, `optional` finding several, and the `one`
> and `optional` of model, entity, graph and pipeline queries and of a
> pipeline's selected sources finding a count they do not take MUST be a
> `DecodeError`, the result being no record of the kind asked for: decided
> after the query, never in place of a database or decode failure, and never
> a `DatabaseError`, which PostgreSQL's errors alone are. A registered
> entity's write that reads back no row, pgorm's `RecordNotFound`, is a
> `DecodeError` too.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.streams]
> `stream` on a pool or a connection MUST give an async iterator over a
> statement's rows through pgorm's `query_raw`, each pull giving one row, so
> that the driver's bounded buffer and the socket hold the server back while
> nothing pulls. A second pull while one is pending is refused. The stream holds its
> connection until its last row, which frees it, or until it is closed or
> abandoned early, which discards the connection if rows remained. A pool's
> stream holds a connection of its own; a connection's stream reserves that
> connection, which refuses other work meanwhile. A decode error ends the
> stream as an error, never as its end, and a database error keeps its
> SQLSTATE and the rows before it. A transaction offers no stream.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.transactions]
> Transactions MUST open only through the language's scoped form on a pool or
> a connection, and savepoints only through the same form on a transaction
> (`python.transactions`, `napi.transactions`), as Rust's open only around a
> closure (`conn.tx.closure`). No method begins, commits, rolls back or closes
> one. A transaction takes pgorm's `TransactionMode`: an access mode and an
> isolation level, the combinations PostgreSQL acts on. A savepoint takes
> neither.
>
> Each transaction and savepoint MUST run inside pgorm's closure transaction,
> a task on the runtime serving its commands from inside the closure. A scope
> that ends normally returns `Ok` from the closure, committing or releasing;
> one that ends with an error returns `Err`, rolling back. So pgorm issues the
> `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`, and a connection given up mid-command drops the
> closure's future rather than await a rollback on it. A `COMMIT` that fails
> ends the transaction, discards its connection and is reported with its
> database error. A `ROLLBACK` that fails, which pgorm reports as
> `TransactionError::RollbackFailed`, discards the connection and is reported
> with both errors, as each binding's rule describes. An abandoned scope whose
> `ROLLBACK` fails discards the connection too.
>
> pgorm's rule that a transaction borrows its parent exclusively MUST hold:
> while a transaction is open its connection refuses other work; while a
> savepoint is open its transaction refuses statements and other savepoints;
> and a statement started while another runs on the same transaction is
> refused. Each refusal is a `LifecycleError`, never queued or raced. A closed
> or foreign transaction handle fails explicitly. Nothing is retried: neither
> a write nor a failed transaction.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.cancellation]
> Acquiring a connection, running a statement, opening a transaction or a
> savepoint, and pulling a stream's rows MUST each be cancellable in the
> language's own way (`python.cancellation`, `napi.cancellation`). A cancelled
> operation's outcome is unknown — a write may or may not have happened — so
> the connection it ran on MUST be discarded rather than returned to its pool
> as healthy, and a transaction it ran in ends with nothing committed. A
> cancellation MUST NOT be reported as success, nor promise the rollback of a
> write whose outcome is unknown. An operation cancelled before it started
> sends nothing. Closing a pool or a connection MUST likewise interrupt what
> runs on it, idle transactions and streams included, without waiting for
> them, and leave no background work using a closed handle.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.copy]
> `copy_from(table, format)` and `copy_to(source, format)` MUST build
> pgorm-query's `CopyFromStatement` and `CopyToStatement` (`sql.ast.copy`) in
> the format named — text, CSV or binary — chosen when the statement is
> built. A COPY TO reads a table, the rows of a `Select`, or an INSERT,
> UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE through its RETURNING list. A write with no
> RETURNING list MUST be refused with a `ConstructionError` when the COPY is
> built, as pgorm-query refuses to make it a source. A `Select` source is
> final once the COPY reads it, so its tie limit and WINDOW clause MUST be
> checked then by `check_tie_limit` and `check_windows`. Each option is the
> pgorm-query method of its name, offered where pgorm-query's typed statement
> has it: an option the statement's format or direction does not take MUST be
> refused with a `ConstructionError` as it is set, never written for the
> server to refuse, and a one-character option takes a one-character string.
> COPY takes no parameters, so `inspect()` gives pgorm-query's rendering,
> every value in it a literal, and no values, and a statement terminal MUST
> refuse a COPY.
>
> `copy_in(statement, source)` and `copy_out(statement)` MUST run a COPY
> through pgorm's `CopyTrait` (`conn.copy`) on a pool, a connection and a
> transaction or savepoint. A pool's COPY takes a connection of its own; a
> connection's or transaction's holds it, refusing other work with a
> `LifecycleError` until the COPY ends. `copy_in` takes bytes, or a
> synchronous or asynchronous iterable of bytes; text is refused, never
> encoded implicitly. It pulls the source only as the COPY takes data,
> through a bounded queue, so a large source streams rather than accumulates,
> and gives the rows written as an exact integer. A source that fails, or
> yields anything but bytes, MUST abandon the COPY so that nothing is
> written, and report that failure unchanged: outside a transaction the
> connection stays usable; inside one the transaction is aborted until it is
> rolled back. A row the server refuses is its `DatabaseError` once the data
> is sent. A COPY FROM the server refuses before any data moves leaves its
> connection out of step, so that connection is discarded and a transaction
> on it ends (`conn.copy`).
>
> `copy_out` gives, once the server accepts the statement, an async iterator
> of byte chunks with bounded buffering, holding the server back while
> nothing reads, and refusing a second pull while one is pending. Its end
> frees what it holds. Closing it before its end discards the connection, and
> any transaction on it, which the server would otherwise go on sending to. A
> failure the server reports part way leaves the connection as a failed
> statement does. A cancelled COPY follows `bindings.cancellation`: before it
> finishes it is abandoned, and when its outcome is unknown its connection or
> transaction is discarded.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.copy-rows]
> `copy_in_rows(statement, rows)` and `copy_out_rows(statement)` MUST run a
> binary COPY as rows of values through `conn.copy.rows`, on a pool, a
> connection and a transaction or savepoint, held and released as `copy_in`
> and `copy_out` are (`bindings.copy`). The statement MUST be a COPY in the
> binary format, which each binding's types state; any other is refused. The
> columns are the ones pgorm describes before the COPY starts. A description
> the server refuses is its `DatabaseError`, and leaves the connection or
> transaction as a failed statement does.
>
> `rows` is a synchronous or asynchronous iterable of rows. Text, bytes and
> anything else are refused before anything is sent. Each row is a sequence
> of its columns' values in order; a row that is no sequence abandons the
> COPY. A value is read as a parameter is — null as NULL, a plain value by

> type as a parameter is bound. A row of another width, and a value its
> column's type does not take, MUST be a `ConstructionError` naming the
> columns or the column, abandoning the COPY as a failing source does, so
> nothing is written. Rows are pulled as the COPY takes them, a batch at a
> time, and the call gives the rows written.
>
> `copy_out_rows` gives a `CopyRowStream`: an async iterator of rows, each a
> sequence of values decoded by its column's type as a result column of that
> type is (`bindings.values`), fetched as they arrive with bounded buffering,

> stream does.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.listen+2]
> `listener(capacity)` on a pool MUST open a `Listener` through pgorm's
> `DatabasePool::listener` (`conn.listen`): a connection of its own, opened
> with the pool's configuration and TLS, never one the pool lends, holding at
> most `capacity` notifications unread — a positive whole number, 1024 by
> default, anything else refused before anything is sent. The listener

> Closing the listener, or abandoning its iteration early, closes its

>
> `listen(channel)`, `unlisten(channel)` and `unlisten_all()` MUST send
> pgorm's `LISTEN`, `UNLISTEN` and `UNLISTEN *`, the channel an exact name,
> and MUST be usable while another task iterates the listener. A channel

>
> The listener MUST be an async iterator of `Notification`s carrying
> `channel`, `payload` and `process_id`, pulled one at a time in the order the
> server sent them; a second pull while one is pending is a `LifecycleError`.
> A cancelled pull leaves the listener open and loses no notification: the one
> it waited for is the next pull's. Nothing reconnects a listener. When its
> connection fails or is terminated, iteration MUST yield the notifications
> already received first and then fail with that failure, a `DatabaseError`
> carrying the server's SQLSTATE where it sent one. When a notification
> arrives while `capacity` wait unread, pgorm closes the connection, and the
> pull past the waiting ones MUST fail with a `ConnectionError`. Either closes
> the listener, and iteration then ends. A pull pending when its pool closes
> fails with a `LifecycleError`, and one pending when the listener itself
> closes ends the iteration, as a pull made after it closed does. `listen`
> and `unlisten` on a closed listener are a `LifecycleError`.
>
> `notify(channel, payload)` on a pool, a connection and a transaction MUST
> run pgorm's `notify`, `SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)` with both bound, as a
> statement runs there. So in a transaction it is delivered at commit and
> never after a rollback, and a cancelled one discards the connection as
> `bindings.cancellation` requires. A channel or payload that is not text is
> refused. The server's bounds — a payload of 8000 bytes or more, an
> empty channel, one longer than 63 bytes — are its `DatabaseError`, SQLSTATE

## Statements

Each binding builds pgorm-query's statements and expressions as builder
objects whose methods return new builders, and runs a built statement through
the same terminals that run raw SQL.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.statements]
> Each binding MUST build pgorm-query's statements and expressions through
> builder objects that each own the pgorm-query builder state they stand for,
> held by the native extension. A builder MUST be immutable: each method
> returns a new builder, made from a copy of its receiver's state by the
> pgorm-query method of the same meaning. A builder reused, or extended in two
> directions, leaves itself and each extension unchanged, and reusing one
> expression in two queries mutates neither nor leaks parameters between
> them. A builder is made only by the binding's own constructors. An argument
> a method cannot use MUST be refused as the method is called, so a statement
> that cannot be built never exists to be run. A binding owns its Rust state;
> it MUST NOT extend a borrowed lifetime or bypass a Rust typestate with an
> unchecked cast.
>
> `inspect()` MUST give the SQL and the bound values, in placeholder order and
> each a `Value` carrying its kind, that running the builder sends: a
> statement as it runs, an expression as the one item of a `SELECT`, and a
> condition as the `WHERE` of `SELECT TRUE`. Running and inspecting use the
> same builder state. The terminals (`bindings.results`) take a built
> statement where they take raw SQL and build it with the function `inspect()`
> uses, binding its values as any parameter is bound. An expression or a
> condition is no statement to run. A statement binding more than 65,535
> values MUST be refused with a `ConstructionError` before anything is sent.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.identifiers+2]
> Identifiers, qualified type names, values, typed structural choices and raw
> SQL MUST each have their own constructors, so no one is taken for another.
> Every identifier — of a column, a table, a schema, an alias, a collation, a
> common table expression or a type — MUST be text of 1 to 63 UTF-8 bytes
> without NUL, minted with `Name::runtime`, so it is quoted wherever
> pgorm-query writes it and a dot in it is part of the name; any other text is
> a `ConstructionError`. Schema, table and column names are runtime inputs;
> no fixture's names are required. Accepted text MUST reach the Rust API
> unchanged, quotes, percent signs, backslashes and Unicode included. A
> language or PostgreSQL limit on a representation MUST be an explicit error,
> never a silent normalization.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.select+2]
> `select` MUST build pgorm-query's `SelectStatement` through the Rust
> builder's own methods:
>
> - a projection of expressions, aliased expressions and windowed calls, `*`
>   until one is given;
> - FROM items: a `Table`, schema-qualified and aliased, or a `FromItem`,
>   which is always aliased; a table's `tablesample`, by the Bernoulli or
>   system method with a bound percentage and an optional bound seed
>   (`sql.ast.select.table-sample`); a table function over function calls,
>   `ROWS FROM` over several, `WITH ORDINALITY` and its column names, and for
>   a call returning `record` a non-empty column definition list, each name
>   and type lowered into pgorm-query's `column_definition`
>   (`sql.ast.select.table-function`, `sql.ast.select.column-definitions`);
>   and `JSON_TABLE` (`bindings.sql-json`);
> - inner, left, right and full joins on a predicate, and cross joins;
> - WHERE and HAVING, each call ANDed to what is there;
> - GROUP BY over expressions and the grouping elements — a grouping set, the
>   empty set, ROLLUP, CUBE and GROUPING SETS, which takes its first element
>   so it is never empty, an expression among its elements being the set of
>   itself — and `group_by_distinct` (`sql.ast.select.grouping`,
>   `sql.ast.select.group-distinct`);
> - ORDER BY with a direction and NULLS FIRST or LAST;
> - LIMIT and OFFSET, each a non-negative integer within PostgreSQL's `bigint`,
>   or null to remove one, any other integer a `ConstructionError`; and
>   `limit_with_ties`, the same count in LIMIT's slot;
> - DISTINCT;
> - UNION, INTERSECT and EXCEPT, each with its ALL form;
> - a WINDOW clause (`bindings.windows`).
>
> `limit_with_ties` is refused with a `ConstructionError` by pgorm-query's
> `check_tie_limit` (`sql.ast.select.tie-limit`) when the statement has no
> ORDER BY or locks SKIP LOCKED. The order may be added after the limit, so
> the method cannot refuse it: `inspect()` and every run do. A method reading
> the statement into another — a subquery, a set operation's arm, an
> INSERT's rows, a common table expression's body, a view or a COPY — refuses
> it as it is called, since nothing can order it after.
>
> A set operation reads the other `Select` into this one as a parenthesised
> arm, its tie limit checked as it is read; anything but a `Select` is
> refused. The arms are written in call order after the receiver's HAVING
> and WINDOW clauses, and combine in call order, as Rust's do:
> `a.union(b).intersect(c)` is `(a UNION b) INTERSECT c`, everything before
> an INTERSECT that follows a UNION or EXCEPT parenthesised so PostgreSQL's
> precedence cannot regroup it (`sql.ast.select.union`). The receiver's ORDER
> BY, LIMIT and OFFSET, whenever they were set, order and bound the combined
> rows, and its WITH clause precedes every arm.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.from-subqueries]
> A `Select` MUST become a FROM item under an alias, `as(alias)`, read as a
> subquery wherever a FROM item is read — the FROM list, a join, a MERGE's
> source — its tie limit and windows checked as it is read. A join MUST take
> a lateral option, which reads its item `LATERAL`, so a subquery joined
> lateral can read the columns of the items before it.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.row-locks]
> A `Select` MUST take a row lock: one of the four strengths — FOR UPDATE, FOR
> NO KEY UPDATE, FOR SHARE and FOR KEY SHARE — OF the FROM items named, each
> by the name it answers to in the statement, and with NOWAIT or SKIP LOCKED,
> through pgorm-query's own lock builder.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.with+1]
> A WITH clause MUST hold common table expressions in call order, each named.
> A body is a `Select`, or a MERGE with a RETURNING list. A SELECT and a MERGE
> take a WITH clause.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.cte-options]
> A common table expression MUST take an optional column list and an optional
> materialization, MATERIALIZED or NOT MATERIALIZED. `WITH RECURSIVE` MUST
> hold exactly one, whose body is a `Select`, with SEARCH (breadth or depth
> first, by an expression, into a column) and CYCLE (by an expression, into a
> mark column, using a path column); a second one is a `ConstructionError`. A
> MERGE's WITH clause is never recursive, as PostgreSQL refuses it, so a
> recursive one given a MERGE is a `ConstructionError`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.write-ctes]
> INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE MUST each take a WITH clause (`bindings.with`),
> and each, with a RETURNING list, MUST be a common table expression's body,
> whose rows are those its RETURNING list yields.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.writes+1]
> `insert`, `update` and `delete` MUST build pgorm-query's INSERT, UPDATE and
> DELETE. An INSERT names its distinct columns before any row. Each `values`
> call adds one row of exactly as many operands, by pgorm-query's arity check,
> and `default_values` writes one row of defaults, mixed with neither.
>
> `on_conflict` takes only a completed action: do nothing, answering any
> conflict; or an arbiter — a non-empty list of columns, with an optional
> partial-index predicate — followed by do nothing or a non-empty update of
> columns taken from EXCLUDED or set to expressions, with an optional
> condition.
>
> An UPDATE has at least one assignment, each column once. An INSERT with no
> row, an UPDATE with no assignment, and an UPDATE or DELETE with neither a
> WHERE nor an explicit `all_rows()` MUST be refused with a
> `ConstructionError` when it is inspected or run. `returning` gives the
> RETURNING list, every column when it is empty, and reads a written row's old
> and new versions through `ReturningRow`'s old and new rows, renamed with
> the `old_as` and `new_as` options.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.write-sources]
> An INSERT MUST take its rows from a `Select` of as many columns as it names,
> through `select`, by pgorm-query's arity check and mixed with neither
> `values` nor `default_values`, the `Select` checked as a subquery is as it
> is read (`bindings.select`); and it MUST take `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` or
> `OVERRIDING USER VALUE`. An UPDATE MUST read further FROM items through
> `from`, and a DELETE through `using`, each a `Table` or a FROM item.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.conflict-arbiters]
> A conflict arbiter's non-empty list MUST take index expressions beside
> columns, its partial-index predicate covering both, and an arbiter MUST
> instead name a constraint, `on_constraint(name)`, which takes no predicate:
> a predicate given one is a `ConstructionError`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.merge+1]
> `merge(target, source, on)` MUST follow pgorm-query's MERGE typestate. Its
> source is a table. It gives a `PendingMerge`, which has no `inspect()` and
> which every terminal refuses with a `ConstructionError`, because PostgreSQL
> refuses a MERGE with no WHEN arm; its first arm gives the `Merge`
> statement. `when_matched` and `when_not_matched_by_source` take an
> action on a target row — an update, which takes its first assignment and so
> is never empty, a delete, or do nothing — and `when_not_matched` an action
> on a source row — an insert, likewise never empty and taking OVERRIDING,
> an insert of default values, or do nothing. Any other pairing MUST be a
> `ConstructionError`. Each arm takes an optional condition. Within a kind of
> row the unconditional arm renders after the conditional ones, and a later
> one replaces it, as pgorm-query orders them. `returning` reads a row's
> versions as a write's does; `returning_action()` puts `merge_action()`
> first in the list, its only form; and `only()` writes `ONLY` before the
> target. A MERGE reads a common table expression and, with a RETURNING list,
> is a common table expression's body (`bindings.with`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.merge-sources]
> A MERGE's source MUST be, beside a table, any FROM item: a subquery
> (`bindings.from-subqueries`), a table function, a sampled table or
> `JSON_TABLE`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.windows]
> `over` MUST attach a window only to what pgorm-query's `WindowFunction`
> admits — a function call, or the JSON aggregates `json_arrayagg` and
> `json_objectagg` — and anything else is a `ConstructionError`. The call
> under it is a projection item, named with `as`. Its window is a `Window`,
> or an `ExtendedWindow(base)` built on an entry of the statement's WINDOW
> clause, written inline, or the name of an entry the clause declares.
>
> `window(name, window)` MUST append an entry to the WINDOW clause, which
> holds every entry in call order, as `SelectStatement::window` appends them:
> a `Window`, or an `ExtendedWindow(base)`, which builds pgorm-query's
> `ExtendedWindow` on an earlier entry with an ORDER BY and a frame and has no
> `partition_by` (`sql.ast.window-statement`); anything else is refused. A
> clause PostgreSQL refuses — a name declared twice, or an extended window
> whose base is no earlier entry, has a frame, or already orders its rows when
> it adds an ORDER BY — a call over a name the clause does not declare, and a
> call over an inline extended window whose base no entry declares, has a
> frame, or already orders its rows when it adds an ORDER BY, are refused by
> pgorm-query's `check_windows` with a `ConstructionError`, where the tie
> limit is checked: by `inspect()` and every run, and by a method reading the
> statement into another as it is called.
>
> A `Window` builds pgorm-query's `WindowStatement` with PARTITION BY, ORDER
> BY and a frame. A frame MUST follow pgorm-query's frame typestate, which
> types a start by the side of the current row it lies on: a start from
> ROWS, RANGE or GROUPS offers only the ends that may follow it, so no frame
> can be built whose end lies on an earlier side than its start, that starts
> at `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` or ends at `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`; a following start
> does not stand alone as a frame; and an exclusion belongs to a frame. Two
> offsets on one side are not compared, as PostgreSQL's grammar does not
> compare them: `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 3 PRECEDING` builds and holds
> no rows. `window_function` builds PostgreSQL's general-purpose window
> functions at the argument counts each takes, usable only through `over`,
> which the server requires of them; another name or count is a
> `ConstructionError`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.sql-json]
> SQL/JSON's query functions `json_exists`, `json_value` and `json_query`, its
> constructors `json_object`, `json_array`, `json_array_query`,
> `json_objectagg`, `json_arrayagg`, `json_parse` (`JSON(..)`), `json_scalar`
> and `json_serialize`, `format_json`, and `is_json` and `is_not_json` MUST
> lower into pgorm-query's SQL/JSON builders, each clause applied through the
> builder's own method. A path is text pgorm-query binds as text cast to
> `jsonpath`; PASSING takes variable names, each an identifier, mapped to
> values. Behaviours are typed per function, so a choice PostgreSQL refuses
> for a function cannot be passed: `json_exists` takes true, false, unknown or
> error; `json_value` null, error or a DEFAULT value; `json_query` those, an
> empty array or an empty object, and one shaping of with wrapper, with
> conditional wrapper or omit quotes. A choice the Rust builder cannot
> express MUST be an error rather than be dropped. A DEFAULT value is written
> as an escaped literal, because PostgreSQL refuses a parameter there, and one
> that carries an enum's or a created range's cast is refused. RETURNING
> takes a `DataType` or a built-in type's name, and `json_value` refuses
> `json` and `jsonb`. `json_arrayagg`'s ordering takes no NULLS placement, and
> one that asks for it is refused rather than dropped.
>
> `json_table(context, path, columns, alias)` MUST build a FROM item through
> `Func::json_table`: its columns a non-empty list of ordinality, value,
> query, exists and nested columns, each taking only the clauses its kind of

## Expressions

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.operands]
> A value an operand is given that is not an expression MUST be bound, in
> statements and pipelines alike, never written into the SQL: in a statement
> as `bindings.expressions` binds it, and in a pipeline inferred or declared
> with `Value` as a parameter is, an interval included, and minted as a
> placeholder by the binder of the stage that takes it, a stage given no
> binder function taking its binder form (`bindings.pipeline-binder`) when one
> of its operands binds. A window's partition and ordering take no value.
>
> Both bindings MUST offer `literal(value)` in statements and in pipelines,
> the one way a value reaches the SQL text, never by concatenation: a
> statement's through pgorm-query's own rendering of a constant
> (`SimpleExpr::Constant`), the value read as a parameter is read and cast as
> its kind needs, an enum's label to its type and a created range's text to
> its range; a pipeline's as pgorm's pipeline writes a literal
> (`bindings.pipeline-expressions`). The literal path and the bound path stay
> apart: neither replaces the other.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.expressions+2]
> An expression MUST lower into pgorm-query's own builders. `col` is a column,
> qualified by a table and its schema. An operand that is not an expression is
> a value bound as a parameter, never interpolated: inferred as a parameter
> is, or declared with `Value`, an enum's label written cast to its type and a
> created range's text cast to its range through `Expr::as_range`. `bind`
> makes a value an expression. An `Interval` binds as pgorm's interval value
> (`sql.value.interval`), its fields kept apart. A null operand, which has no
> kind to bind, MUST be a `ConstructionError` naming the explicit form.
>
> Comparison and arithmetic, `||` (`concat`), `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM`, AND,
> OR, NOT, `IS [NOT] NULL`, `[NOT] BETWEEN [SYMMETRIC]` and `[NOT] IN` a list —
> an empty one included, which no value is in — or a `Select`'s rows MUST each
> be the pgorm-query method of that meaning, and `Condition.all` and
> `Condition.any` pgorm-query's `Condition`, an empty one true and false.
> Condition grouping and empty conditions mean what the named Rust API means.
>
> `like`, `ilike`, `similar_to` and their negations take a pattern, bound, and
> an optional escape of one character, or the empty string, which turns
> escaping off (`sql.ast.expr.similar-to`). `regex` (`~`), `not_regex`
> (`!~`), `iregex` (`~*`) and `not_iregex` (`!~*`) match a POSIX regular
> expression. `matches` (`@@`) is `BinOper::Matches`, full-text search or a
> `jsonpath` predicate. `path_exists` (`@?`) takes a `jsonpath` as text,
> bound as pgorm-query's `json_path_exists` binds it, as text cast to
> `jsonpath`; any other value is a `ConstructionError`. `starts_with`,
> `ends_with` and `contains_text` read their argument as text through
> PostgreSQL's `starts_with`, `right` and `strpos`, so `%` and `_` match
> themselves. The other operand of each binary operator is bound unless it is
> an expression.
>
> `call` reaches only the functions pgorm-query has a constructor for, at the
> argument counts each takes — `uuidv7` with or without its shift among them
> — and another name or count is a `ConstructionError`: the name selects a
> constructor and never reaches SQL. `generate_series`, with or without its
> step, and `unnest` are the set-returning ones a table function reads, and
> `json_to_record`, `jsonb_to_record`, `json_to_recordset` and
> `jsonb_to_recordset` the record-returning ones it reads through a column
> definition list. `tuple` is a row of expressions, never empty.
>
> A cast names its type by name or `TypeName`. `at(index)` is pgorm-query's
> `Expr::index` (`a[index]`) and `slice(lower, upper)` its `Subscript::Slice`
> (`a[lower:upper]`), a null bound leaving that end open and each bound bound
> unless it is an expression. `exists(select)` is `Expr::exists`;
> `scalar(select)` is the scalar subquery `(select)`; and `array(select)` is
> `Expr::array`, `ARRAY(select)`: the subquery's one column as one array
> value, empty when it yields no row, which casts and compares as a value
> (`sql.ast.expr`), the server refusing a subquery of more than one column
> (`42601`). Each subquery is checked as any embedded subquery is.
> `domain_value()` is `Expr::domain_value()`, the keyword `VALUE` a domain's
> CHECK tests. `asc()` and `desc()` give an ordering, with NULLS FIRST or
> LAST, and `as(alias)` an aliased projection item.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.quantifiers+1]
> `any(source)` and `all(source)` MUST be `ANY (..)` and `ALL (..)`:
> pgorm-query's `Expr::any` / `Expr::all` over a `Select`'s rows, and
> `Func::any` / `Func::all` over an array, an expression or a value bound as
> one array parameter. Each is a `Quantified`, no expression, and MUST be
> taken as the right operand of each operator PostgreSQL reads one after:
> every operator its grammar takes before `ANY` or `ALL` whose result is a
> boolean, which the server requires of one:
>
> - the comparisons `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt` and `gte`;
> - `like`, `not_like`, `ilike` and `not_ilike`, the quantifier ranging over
>   patterns with no escape, since the grammar reads no `ESCAPE` after one;
> - `regex`, `not_regex`, `iregex` and `not_iregex`;
> - `contains`, `contained_by` and `overlaps`;
> - `strictly_left_of`, `strictly_right_of`, `not_extend_right_of`,
>   `not_extend_left_of` and `adjacent_to`;
> - `matches` and `path_exists`, the latter's quantifier ranging over
>   `jsonpath` values: PostgreSQL reads a bound array there as `jsonpath[]`,
>   which pgorm sends no text as, so an array of text is a
>   `ConstructionError` as the statement runs, and one cast to `jsonpath[]`
>   is sent.
>
> Each is the pgorm-query operator of its meaning with the quantifier as its
> right operand. The grammar reads none after `similar_to`, `not_similar_to`,
> `is_distinct_from`, `is_not_distinct_from`, `between` or a membership test,
> and the server refuses one after an operator whose result is no boolean
> (`42809`), arithmetic and `concat`. Those operators, an escape given with a
> quantified pattern, every other operand position, a membership list and
> `bind` MUST refuse it with a `ConstructionError`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.case]
> `case_when(condition, result)` MUST build a searched CASE and
> `case_of(operand)` a simple CASE through pgorm-query's CASE builder
> (`sql.ast.case`). A CASE exists as an expression only once it has an arm:
> `case_of(operand)` gives an operand that takes `when(value, result)` before
> it is one, and every CASE takes further `when` arms and one `else` result.
> Each value and result is bound unless it is an expression, and a CASE is an
> expression wherever an expression goes.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.ranges]
> `contains` (`@>`), `contained_by` (`<@`) and `overlaps` (`&&`) MUST compare
> ranges, multiranges and arrays through pgorm-query's operators of that
> meaning, and `strictly_left_of` (`<<`), `strictly_right_of` (`>>`),
> `not_extend_right_of` (`&<`), `not_extend_left_of` (`&>`) and
> `adjacent_to` (`-|-`) MUST place ranges and multiranges through them. A
> range or multirange operand is bound as the `Value` that declares its kind —
> a built-in range or multirange kind, or a `CreatedRange` or
> `CreatedMultirange`, whose text is cast to its type through
> `Expr::as_range` — and a `Range` or `Multirange` given without one MUST be a
> `ConstructionError`, a range's kind never being inferred.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.collations]
> `collate(name, schema)` on an expression MUST put it under a collation
> through Rust's `Expr::collate` (`sql.ast.expr.collate`), written
> `(expr COLLATE "name")`, the schema first when one is given. It gives an
> expression, so the collated value goes on to be compared, and `asc()` or
> `desc()` over it writes the clause into the sort key, which is where
> PostgreSQL's grammar reads an ORDER BY's collation.
>
> `collate(name, schema)` on a `ColumnDef` MUST give the column its one
> collation through Rust's `ColumnDef::collate` (`sql.ddl.column-def`),
> written `COLLATE` after the type, a later call replacing an earlier, since
> PostgreSQL refuses a column with two. Creating a table or adding a column
> writes it where the column is declared, and modifying a column writes it on
> the column's retype, `ALTER COLUMN .. TYPE .. COLLATE`, the only place
> PostgreSQL changes a column's collation; every comparison and sort over the
> column then uses it. A domain's base takes one the same way
> (`bindings.schema-domains`).
>
> The name and the schema are each an identifier (`bindings.identifiers`),
> and one that is not MUST be refused with a `ConstructionError` before
> anything is built. What only the server knows it refuses by SQLSTATE, as a
> `DatabaseError`: a collation that does not exist (`42704`) and a collation
> on a type without one (`42804`).

## Models

A model is data the application declares: a table and its columns, lowered
into the statement builders. It claims no Rust entity. Its reads and writes
decode into records of its fields, and its relations, graphs, cursors and
pages follow pgorm's own `RelationDef`, `SelectGraph`, `Cursor` and
`Paginator`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.models+3]
> `model(name, columns, schema)` MUST declare a model of a table,
> schema-qualified when a schema is given, from a mapping of fields, each a
> `Column(kind, options)`. The kind is one every result decodes as — any
> value kind but `u64` and `char`, which no column decodes as — or a
> schema-qualified `TypeName`, `CreatedRange` or `CreatedMultirange`, as a
> decoded row names each type. The options are `name` (the SQL column, the
> field's own name by default), `nullable`, `array`, `primary_key`, `default`,
> `generated` (always or by default) and an enum's `values`.
>
> Any other value MUST be a `ConstructionError` raised as the model is
> declared: a key column that is nullable, a generated
> column with a default, labels on a column that is no enum, two fields of
> one column, a field named twice, an enum or created range without its
> schema, and an identifier pgorm would not take. Declaring a model MUST send
> nothing, run no DDL and claim no Rust entity: no derive, `EntityTrait`,
> implementation or ActiveModel hook is behind it. A model and its columns
> never change; `as(alias)` gives another model reading the table under an
> alias. Its columns are qualified as pgorm qualifies an entity's, by the
> table's alias or else its name, never its schema.
>
> A `Column` is a declaration and has no method: the model converts a value
> through the field's column where it takes one, and `Value(data, kind)`
> (`bindings.value-tags`) is the conversion a program calls. `describe()`
> MUST report the model as data: its table's schema, name and alias, its
> primary key, and each field's SQL column, kind, nullability, key
> membership, default, generation and an enum's values.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.model-columns+1]
> `col(field)` MUST be a model field's column, qualified as the model's

## Registered entities

A Rust application that already has pgorm entities registers them with a
binding and builds one native module carrying the binding's whole API and its
registrations. The program reaches each registration by name, and every
operation on one is the entity's own Rust API. A binding cannot instantiate a
Rust generic at run time, only use the ones compiled in.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.entities+2]
> Each binding MUST let a downstream application crate register its own
> entities, `SelectGraph` shapes and pipeline source tuples, for any entity
> whose model converts into its ActiveModel, and build one native module from
> them; the binding's own module registers none. The public package MUST NOT
> be limited to this repository's test fixtures. A name or a Rust entity
> registered twice, and a graph or source tuple whose entities are not
> registered, MUST be refused as they are registered. A binding MUST NOT
> fabricate a generic instantiation at run time.
>
> `entity(name)` and `graph(name)` give one registration, and a name the
> module does not register is a `ConstructionError`; `entities()`, `graphs()`
> and `pipeline.source_tuples()` list the names the module registers of each
> kind, in order. `describe()` reports a
> registration: its table; each column's SQL name, type, nullability, key
> membership and the kind its values bind and read as; its primary key, and
> whether that key ends `WITHOUT OVERLAPS`; its relations, with their columns,
> `PERIOD` pair, enforcement and deferrability (and what decides their joins,
> `bindings.relation-conditions`); and the Rust types behind it. A
> registered entity's records MUST keep the Rust model each was read as.
> Every operation runs as a statement does (`bindings.registered-pools`) —
> refused while another holds the connection, cancellable, the connection
> discarded when cancellation leaves its state unknown — and a failure is the
> error `bindings.errors` classifies.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.relation-conditions]
> A registration's `describe()` MUST report, for each relation, its condition
> type, all or any, and whether an `on_condition` adds a condition of its own,
> the Rust closure reported as present or absent only: both change what a
> join by the relation means.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.registered-pools]
> Every operation on a registration — an entity query's terminals, an
> ActiveModel's writes, the version terminals, a registered graph's
> terminals and a source selection's terminals — MUST run on a pool as well
> as on a connection or a transaction. On a pool it runs on a connection lent
> to it alone, as a pool's statement does.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.entity-reads+2]
> `find()` MUST be the entity's `E::find()`, and `where`, `order_by`,
> `limit` and `offset` the `Select<E>` methods of the same meaning. `all`,
> `one` and `optional` MUST be `Select::all`, `one` and `one_opt`, `one` and
> `optional` narrowing the row limit to one as Rust does, and `one` finding
> no row an error. `inspect()` gives the SQL and values a terminal sends.
>
> `col(name)` is the column as the entity's `ColumnTrait` names it, and its
> comparisons MUST be that trait's methods: a value converted to the column's
> declared kind and written through the column's `save_as` — an enum's label
> cast to its type, and a column whose domain is over an enum compared as the
> enum, the column and the label each cast to it. An expression, or
> `any(..)` / `all(..)`, is compared as written, and null is refused. Its
> `is_in` and `is_not_in` MUST be the trait's `is_in` / `is_not_in` over a
> list of values, each converted as a compared value is, and its
> `in_subquery` / `not_in_subquery` over a `Select`, so a column whose domain
> is over an enum is a member as the enum and the subquery's projection is
> cast beside it. A list holding an expression is a member as written.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.entity-writes]
> `active()` MUST be the entity's `ActiveModelBehavior::new`, its defaults
> included, and turning a record into an ActiveModel the real
> `IntoActiveModel` of the model behind the record. An ActiveModel MUST
> report each column as not set, set or unchanged, and `set`, `not_set` and
> `reset` give a new one, a value converted to the column's declared kind or
> refused. Omitted, explicit NULL and assigned values stay distinct. Its
> `insert`, `update` and `delete` MUST be `ActiveModelTrait`'s, the
> application's `ActiveModelBehavior` hooks running around them, and a hook's
> refusal a `ConstructionError`. Setting a value on a record is
> `ModelTrait::set` on a copy, writing nothing, and a record's tagged value
> is the column's value with the kind the entity declares. A record or an
> ActiveModel of another registration MUST be refused.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.entity-versions+2]
> The write terminals that read a row's two versions MUST be the statement
> terminals they are in Rust, so no `ActiveModelBehavior` hook runs around
> them: an update's `returning_change` is `UpdateOne::exec_returning_change`;
> `update_many()`'s `returning_changes` is `UpdateMany::exec_returning_changes`;
> and an insert's `returning_upsert` and `insert_many`'s `returning_upserts`
> are `Insert::exec_returning_upsert` and `Insert::exec_returning_upserts`. A
> change holds two records, old and new. An upsert is inserted, holding the
> new record, or updated, holding both. A row a conflict clause held back is
> null from `returning_upsert` and left out of `returning_upserts`.
> `update_many().set` writes a value through the column's `save_as` and takes
> an expression as written. An `update_many()` MUST have `where` or
> `all_rows()` before it runs, a `ConstructionError` otherwise, as a
> statement's UPDATE does (`bindings.writes`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.entity-graphs+2]
> `graph(name).find(aliases)` MUST build the registered `SelectGraph` with the
> application's factory, its declared entity tuple, join slot kinds and
> decoding terminals, each joined slot under the alias given for it, `g1`,

> repeated, or one naming the root's table is refused. Its rows MUST be
> decoded by `GraphRow`: a graph with no slot as the root's record, otherwise
> a tuple of each source's record, an optional slot null where it matched
> nothing, and a present slot that does not decode a `DecodeError`. Required
> rows, optional rows, absent joined sources and decode errors stay distinct.
> `col(source, column)` qualifies a column of a decoded source as the query
> names it; `where` and `order_by` are `SelectGraph`'s; `all` and `optional`
> its terminals, `SelectGraph::all` and `one_opt`. An entity combination or
> arity the module does not register is refused, never lowered to a different
> API.
>
> `cursor(column)` MUST be `SelectGraph::cursor_by` on a root column: `before`
> and `after` bound that column, and `before_with` and `after_with` the whole
> key — the column, the root's other key columns, then each slot's — each
> value converted to its column's declared kind and any other count refused.
> `first`, `last`, `asc` and `desc` are the cursor's own.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.pipeline-sources+2]
> A registered entity MUST be a pipeline source wherever a relation is, read
> through its own `IntoSource`, so its table and schema are the ones its Rust
> declaration names, and `pipeline.col(table, entity.col(name))` MUST lower
> through the registration's own `Named::col`, so the column compares as the
> entity types it. A module registers source tuples of one to six entity
> types, each entity registered first. `pipeline.sources(name)` gives one, and
> another name is a `ConstructionError`.
>
> `select_sources(selection, qualifiers)` MUST be pgorm's `select_sources` as
> the pipeline's last stage, each source projected under the qualifier given
> for it or its table's name, a count of qualifiers other than the sources'
> refused. Its `all`, `one` and `optional` are `SelectedSources`'s `all`,
> `one` and `one_opt`, `one` and `optional` taking one row. Each row is a
> tuple of the sources' records, decoded through each entity's absence
> witness, a source a row does not carry being null. A pipeline reshaped
> before the selection is the `ConstructionError` pgorm's refusal names,
> before anything is sent.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.codegen]
> Each binding MUST offer a documented workflow that generates, from a
> description of a downstream application's entities, graph shapes and
> source tuples, a crate registering exactly what is described and a module of
> typed wrappers over it (`python.codegen`, `napi.codegen-types`). Generation
> MUST preserve qualified names, column mappings, enum types and optional
> decode shapes, and MUST refuse, before anything is written, a description
> whose Rust paths are not paths to items of the crate, whose names repeat
> within a kind or collide, whose entity is registered twice, or whose source
> tuple lists an entity it does not describe. The output is the same bytes
> each time from the same build. Compilation happens when the definitions or
> the shapes change, not when a program builds another query over the
> installed types. The generated module MUST check, as it loads, that the
> native module and every registration it names describe as they did when it
> was written, and refuse to load otherwise.

## Pipelines

Each binding composes pgorm's PRQL-shaped pipeline, `pgorm::pipeline`:
relation-to-relation stages over sources, compiled through prqlc to
PostgreSQL SQL, with runtime values entering through a binder whose
placeholders belong to the stage that minted them.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.pipeline]
> The binding's `pipeline` module MUST compose `pgorm::pipeline::Pipeline`,
> each object owning the pgorm state it stands for and each stage returning a
> new pipeline from a copy: `from(source)` and the stages `filter`, `derive`,
> `select`, `group` followed by `aggregate`, `window`, `sort`, `take(n)`,
> `take_range(start, end)`, `join(source, on, kind)`, `append`, `intersect`,
> `remove` and `distinct`. A source is a `Table`, schema-qualified and read
> under its alias when it has one, another `Pipeline` embedded whole with its
> bound values, a registered entity
> (`bindings.pipeline-sources`), or `source(relation).named(name)`, which
> reads a relation under a name of its own. A grouping is no pipeline until it
> is aggregated, so `group` gives a `Grouped` whose only way back is
> `aggregate`, and which no terminal runs. A row count is an integer, never an
> expression, as PRQL refuses a bound LIMIT.
>
> A `Pipeline` is a statement for the terminals (`bindings.results`),
> compiled through `Pipeline::into_sql` as `inspect()` compiles it, its values
> bound as any statement's are, `one` and `optional` keeping their
> cardinality. What pgorm's compile step judges — a name it cannot write as
> one, a reserved alias, a relation or column prqlc cannot resolve — MUST be a
> `ConstructionError` from `inspect()` or the terminal, before anything is
> sent.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.pipeline-expressions+2]
> Pipeline expressions MUST be objects of their own, lowered into
> `pgorm::pipeline::Expr` only as a stage takes them, never mixed with the
> statement builders' expressions: `col(table, column)`, qualified as prqlc
> requires; `alias(name)`, a name a stage introduces, read back unqualified;
> `this(name)` and `that(name)`, a join's two sides; the operators `eq` ..
> `lte`, and, or, not, negation, `add` .. `rem`, `coalesce`, `is_null`,
> `is_not_null`, `in_array`, `cast` over pgorm's closed `CastType` set, `as`,
> `asc` and `desc`; `compares_as(type)`, a name or a `TypeName`, lowered
> through `ExprOps::compares_as`, the enum a column no registration types
> compares as (`entity.traits.column.enum-cast`); `case(arms, otherwise)`;
> and the aggregates and window functions pgorm's pipeline has, each at the
> argument count it takes. `over()` builds a window's partition, ordering
> and ROWS or RANGE frame, and takes no value, bound or not, as pgorm's `Over`
> takes none.
>
> `literal(value)` — null, a boolean, an integer within `bigint`, a finite
> float, or text — is written into the SQL as pgorm's pipeline writes a
> literal. A value bound through a stage's binder (`bindings.pipeline-binder`)
> is a placeholder, inferred or declared with `Value` as a parameter is, an
> interval included. A value with no kind and a value whose kind needs a cast
> pgorm's pipeline cannot write (an enum's or a created range's) MUST be a
> `ConstructionError` naming the explicit form. A plain operand is bound by
> the stage that takes it (`bindings.operands`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.pipeline-binder]
> Each expression-taking stage MUST have a binder form — `filter_with`,
> `derive_with`, `select_with`, `group_with`, `aggregate_with`,
> `window_with`, `sort_with` and `join_with` — that calls its function once,
> synchronously, with a `Binder`, whose `bind(value)` mints one placeholder
> for one value, reusable within the stage. A placeholder is branded with the
> scope of the call that minted it, as pgorm's binder brands it with a
> lifetime, and the binding's ownership MUST NOT erase that discipline. Once
> the function has returned or failed, the binder MUST refuse to bind, and an
> expression carrying its placeholder MUST be refused, each with a
> `LifecycleError`, as any handle used after it closed is. So MUST an
> expression that combines two scopes' placeholders, and one given to a stage
> other than the one its function returns it to — a plain stage, another
> call's or another pipeline's — or to a window's partition or ordering.
>
> The function MUST return its result directly, never through the language's
> asynchronous form: an operand for a filter or a join condition, and an
> expression or a list of operands for a list-taking stage; anything else
> there is refused. A list of more than 32 is a `ConstructionError`:
> pgorm's list-taking `_with` stages take a fixed-size array, which the
> binding dispatches up to that bound, where a stage that binds nothing takes
> a list of any length.

## Schema

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema]
> Each binding MUST build DDL through pgorm-query's DDL builders, each object
> owning the builder state it stands for, immutable as a statement builder is:
> a method gives a new builder from a copy, and an argument it cannot use is
> refused as it is given, an option the builder does not know among them, so
> that a misspelt option is never left out of a statement. Constructing one
> does no I/O, and nothing runs DDL but a terminal: declaring a model or
> importing a module MUST NOT execute DDL.
>
> Every complete DDL statement is the binding's DDL class, a statement the
> terminals take; only the binding's DDL constructors make one. A schema is a
> database schema alone (`bindings.schema-schemas`), as it is in pgorm-query
> (`sql.ddl`). PostgreSQL takes no parameters in DDL, so a DDL statement MUST
> render through pgorm-query's own rendering, which writes every value it
> carries — a DEFAULT, a CHECK's operands, an enum label, a comment, an
> extension's version, a view's query — as an escaped literal, and MUST run
> through the terminals as that SQL text with no values beside it; `inspect()`
> gives the same SQL and an empty value list. No name or value is
> concatenated into SQL by the binding: every identifier is minted with
> `Name::runtime` and quoted where pgorm-query writes it. A table or sequence
> is named by text or by a `Table`, whose schema qualifies it and which MUST
> NOT carry an alias; a type by text or a `TypeName`, keeping its schema
> qualification, quoting and type identity.
>
> pgorm-query's typestates hold: an `ALTER` that names its object and no
> action yet MUST have no `inspect()`, every terminal MUST refuse it with a
> `ConstructionError`, and its first action gives the statement. A
> `ColumnDef` is no statement, and a terminal refuses it likewise.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-api+2]
> Each binding MUST spell the DDL `bindings.schema` describes as these
> functions and the builders they give, every complete statement of the `DDL`
> class or a class extending it, so a statement the terminals take; no class
> is named `SchemaStatement`. A statement is made by its factory, never by its
> class: `DDL`, each builder, each pending `ALTER` and `EntitySchema` are
> exported for annotations and `isinstance` (`instanceof`) and cannot be
> called, a call being a `TypeError`, as Python's `Expr` is made only by
> `col()` and `bind()`. Python's stubs give each such class an `__init__`
> taking `Never`, and JavaScript's declarations a private or protected
> constructor. A `ColumnDef` and a `DataType` are parts of a statement, not
> statements, and are made by calling their classes. The factories are:
>
> - `create_table(table)` gives a `CreateTable` with `column`, `primary_key`,
>   `unique`, `foreign_key`, `check` and `if_not_exists`, and
>   `ColumnDef(name, type)` a column, its type left out for a `modify_column`
>   that does not retype it;
> - `alter_table(table)` gives a `PendingAlterTable`, whose first action gives
>   an `AlterTable` that takes more; `drop_table`, `rename_table`,
>   `rename_column`, `rename_constraint` and `truncate_table` give
>   statements;
> - `create_index(table, entry)`, with the option `name`, gives a
>   `CreateIndex` with `column`, `unique`, `nulls_not_distinct`,
>   `if_not_exists`, `using`, `include` and `where`, an entry being a name or
>   an expression with the options `order` and `operator_class`, which
>   JavaScript gives as one object `{ on, order, operatorClass }`;
>   `drop_index(table, name)` gives a statement;
> - `create_type(name)` gives a `CreateType` with `as_enum`, `values`,
>   `as_composite`, `attribute` and `as_range`; `alter_type(name)` a
>   `PendingAlterType` with `add_value`, `rename_to`, `rename_value`,
>   `rename_attribute` (a `RenameAttribute`) and the composite's
>   `add_attribute`, `drop_attribute` and `alter_attribute` (an
>   `AlterComposite`); and `drop_type(names)`;
> - `create_sequence(name)` gives a `CreateSequence` and
>   `alter_sequence(name)` a `PendingAlterSequence`, whose first clause gives
>   an `AlterSequence`; `options` and an identity take the sequence options
>   as options, and `owned_by` with no table is `OWNED BY NONE`;
>   `drop_sequence`, `rename_sequence`, `create_extension(name)`,
>   `drop_extension(name)`, `comment_on_table` and `comment_on_column` give
>   statements;
> - `create_view(name, query)` gives a `CreateView` with `or_replace`,

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-tables]

> A `ColumnDef(name, type)` takes a `DataType`, a built-in type's name, a

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-indexes]
> Creating an index MUST build pgorm-query's `IndexCreateStatement` over its
> first entry, and further entries append. An entry is a column's name or an
> expression, with an optional order, ascending or descending, and an
> optional operator class. The index takes `unique`; `nulls_not_distinct`,

> predicate ANDed to one already there. CONCURRENTLY is not offered,
> PostgreSQL refusing it in a transaction. Dropping an index drops it from its
> table's schema, with `if_exists`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-types]
> Creating a type MUST build pgorm-query's `TypeCreateStatement`, a shell
> type until a kind is chosen, its kind one slot as pgorm-query holds it: an

> subtype and its optional subtype operator class, collation, subtype
> difference function and multirange type name. An enum label is data,
> written as a literal, and MUST be at most 63 bytes without NUL, as
> PostgreSQL stores it; the empty label is one.
>
> Altering a type MUST give one change: adding a value before or after
> another, never both; renaming the type, whose new name is bare; renaming a
> value; renaming an attribute, with a behavior; or a composite's adding,
> dropping (with `if_exists`) and altering of attributes, which take more of
> their kind and a behavior, cascade carrying the changes into typed tables.
> Dropping types drops one or more, with `if_exists` and a behavior.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-sequences]
> A sequence's options MUST be one vocabulary for a standalone sequence and an
> identity column, pgorm-query's `SequenceOptions`: `increment_by`,
> `min_value`, `max_value`, `start_with`, `cache` and `cycle`, each number an
> integer within `bigint`, a bound's null its NO form, and any other option
> refused. Creating a sequence takes `if_not_exists`, a type (smallint,
> integer or bigint), options, which merge at least one option into those set,
> and OWNED BY a table's column, or NONE. Altering a sequence gives its
> statement with its first clause, and takes the same clauses, `restart` with
> an optional value, and `if_exists`. Dropping and renaming a sequence build
> pgorm-query's statements. Creating an extension, with `if_not_exists`, a
> schema, a version and CASCADE, and dropping one, with `if_exists` and a
> behavior, build pgorm-query's extension statements, the version a literal.
> Commenting on a table and on a column build its COMMENT ON, the text a
> literal pgorm-query escapes.

> [spec:pgorm:req:bindings.schema-views+2]
> Views, materialized views and tables created from a query MUST be built
> through pgorm-query's builders for them (`sql.ddl.view`,
> `sql.ddl.materialized-view`, `sql.ddl.create-table-as`), each named as a

> Each ALTER DOMAIN action gives a whole statement over the domain it names,
