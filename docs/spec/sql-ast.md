# SQL AST (pgorm-query statement and expression tree)

pgorm-query models SQL statements as plain Rust data structures — an abstract
syntax tree built through fluent, mutating builder methods — which are rendered
to PostgreSQL text by the backend `QueryBuilder` only when a build method is
called. This document specifies the AST layer: the statement types under
`pgorm-query/src/query/`, the expression tree in `pgorm-query/src/expr.rs`, and
function calls in `pgorm-query/src/func.rs`. Rules capture what the code does
today, including panicking edges and deliberate failsafes.

## Overview

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast+4]
> pgorm-query MUST provide a programmatic AST for building SQL statements,
> comprising `SelectStatement`, `InsertStatement`, `UpdateStatement`,
> `DeleteStatement` and `MergeStatement`, plus the `Query` shorthand whose
> associated functions (`Query::select()`, `Query::insert()`, `Query::update()`,
> `Query::delete()`, `Query::merge(..)`, `Query::with()`, `Query::returning()`)
> construct fresh builders. `Query::merge` returns a `PendingMerge`, which
> becomes a statement when its first arm is added (`sql.ast.merge`). Builder
> methods MUST mutate in place and return `&mut Self` so calls chain;
> constructing or mutating a statement MUST NOT touch a database.
>
> The five statement kinds MUST be embeddable as a subquery through
> `IntoSubQueryStatement::into_sub_query_statement`. It wraps the statement
> in the `SubQueryStatement` enum (`SelectStatement`, `InsertStatement`,
> `UpdateStatement`, `DeleteStatement`, `MergeStatement`), which is what a
> common table expression and an expression subquery hold, and which
> displays as the statement it wraps, values inlined as that statement's
> `Display` writes them, so a dependent renders one without matching it.
> Every kind is a CTE body on PostgreSQL 18. A MERGE body yields the rows of its RETURNING
> list, and without one it still runs, as an UPDATE does, while reading the
> CTE is refused (`0A000`); the AST leaves that to the server as it does for
> the other write statements (`sql.ast.with`). Only a SELECT nests as an
> expression subquery: the server refuses the four write statements there
> (`42601`), and every typed constructor of an expression subquery
> (`Expr::exists`, `Expr::any`, `in_subquery` and their kin) takes a
> `SelectStatement`, so only the raw `SimpleExpr::SubQuery` variant can hold
> one. Nesting is a trait of its own rather than a method of
> `QueryStatementBuilder`, because what nests is a narrower question than
> what renders.
> There is no variant for a WITH-prefixed statement: a clause is carried
> by the statement it prefixes (`query.build.with`), so the prefix nests
> wherever the statement does.
>
> Where a builder offers `take()`, the method MUST move the accumulated contents
> out and leave the source in its default (empty) state — it may copy only the
> identity field a constructor demanded, never content a caller added. A type
> whose contents cannot be moved out without leaving an invalid value therefore
> has no `take()` at all rather than a `take()` that copies: `SelectStatement`,
> `WindowStatement`, `TableIndex`, `ColumnDef`, `TableCreateStatement` and
> `TableDropStatement` have one; `IndexCreateStatement`,
> `ForeignKeyCreateStatement`, `TableForeignKey`, `TableAlterStatement` and
> `MergeStatement` do not, and a caller who wants a second copy of one writes
> `.to_owned()`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.surface+38]
> The crate's exports are an explicit list, not a set of module globs.
> `pgorm-query/src/lib.rs` MUST name every exported item in `pub use` statements
> grouped by what the items are for — names, expressions, values, query
> statements, COPY, schema statements, rendering — and the modules those items
> are defined in MUST be private, so `use pgorm_query::*` and that list are the
> same set and nothing becomes API by being declared `pub` inside a module a
> caller can reach. Exactly three modules stay public, each because a path through it
> is the spelling callers write: `error` (`Error`, `Result`, `TemplateError`),
> `extension` (the `CREATE EXTENSION` / `CREATE TYPE` surface, deliberately not
> flattened into the root) and `value` (whose `value::with_array::NotU8` pgorm's
> derives name in generated code). `tests_cfg` is `#[doc(hidden)]` behind its
> own feature and is not surface. No module inside the three is public but
> `value::with_array`, the path that spelling takes, and `value` exports
> nothing the list does not.
>
> What the crate reads but a caller cannot use is `pub(crate)`: the renderer's
> `Mode` and `Oper` helpers, the clause shapes a statement holds internally
> (`JoinExpr`, `JoinKind`, `JoinOn`, `LockClause`, `ConditionHolder`), and
> `prepare`'s re-export of `std::fmt::Write`, which put a `std` trait in
> pgorm-query's namespace and was the only path by which `pgorm_query::Write`
> could be written. An item that narrowing would merely turn into dead code is
> instead exported `#[doc(hidden)]`, so the rendered documentation is the
> curated list while the item stays reachable: the `SelectDistinct` flag,
> whose `All` variant no builder sets, and the `Token`/`Tokenizer` lexer behind
> `inject_parameters`, whose classification accessors only the conformance
> suite calls. Each of those MUST be named
> individually in `lib.rs` rather than left to a glob, so the residue is a list
> a later pass can work through rather than a category.
>
> A public enum is `#[non_exhaustive]` when its variants name members of a
> vocabulary that can grow past what the enum holds: what PostgreSQL defines —
> operators, functions, types and values, statement kinds, the clauses,
> actions, options and behaviours a statement takes, the objects a statement
> names — and the kinds of failure a crate reports. Adding a member to one, as
> PostgreSQL 19 (`sql.target`) or wider coverage of 18 does, is then not a
> breaking change. That is `SimpleExpr`, `Function`, `UnOper`, `BinOper`,
> `SubQueryOper`, `Keyword`, `ColumnRef`, `FromItem`, `SubQueryStatement`,
> `Value`, `ArrayType`, `RangeType`, `ColumnType`, `JsonValueType`, `SqlJson`,

> `CopyLogVerbosity`, `Token`, `ValueTupleError`, `error`'s `Error` and
> `TemplateError`, and `extension`'s `TypeAs`, `TypeAlterOpt` and
> `AttributeChange`. Three are open for a reason beyond their present
> variants: `Order` lacks `USING`'s operator sort, `SequenceType` lists the
> three types PostgreSQL chooses to count in rather than all a count could be,
> and `OnConflict` pairs a conflict's arbiter with an action whose vocabulary
> grows. An enum stays exhaustive when its variants partition a choice by
> construction, so that another would change what it means rather than extend
> it and a caller is meant to match every arm: the two sides of a binary

> `IdentityGeneration`, `GeneratedKind`, `Enforcement`, `DropBehavior`,
> `TableDropOpt`, `ConditionType`, `IndexKind`, `ViewCheckOption`,
> `SearchOrder`, and `extension`'s `ExtensionDropOpt`, `TypeDropOpt` and
> `TypeAlterAddOpt`), every combination of independent settings PostgreSQL
> acts on (`Deferrability`), the alternatives of a shape (`TableName`,
> `Subscript`, `IndexColumnTarget`, `ConflictElement`, `ConflictArbiter`,
> `ConditionExpression`, `AnyWithClause`, `WindowSelectType`,
> `WindowDefinition`, `SelectDistinct`, `StringLen`, `IntervalSpec`, `Range`,

> `JoinType`, whose variants are the four answers to which sides keep their
> unmatched rows, and the uninhabited frame-side markers `FramePreceding`,
> `FrameCurrentRow` and `FrameFollowing`. A match on an open
> enum outside the crate ends in an arm for a member it does not know, and in
> this workspace that arm refuses it with the matching crate's own typed error
> — pgorm's, codegen's `TransformError`, a binding's error class — rather than
> reading it as a member it knows. pgorm, pgorm-pool, pgorm-migration and

## Scope

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.scope+23]
> pgorm-query models the PostgreSQL a data-access layer writes, not the whole
> of PostgreSQL, and the boundary MUST be written down rather than discovered.
> A construct outside the builder is still reachable — `Expr::raw` and
> `SqlTemplate` in expression position, `FromItem::Template` in relation
> position, and `ConnectionTrait::execute` / `batch_execute` /
> `query_raw` for a whole statement — so what follows records a decision about
> the *typed* surface, never about what a caller can send. Two things travel
> outside any statement's result, so no route above reaches them, and each has
> a route of its own: `COPY`'s data flow, through `copy_in` and `copy_out`
> (`conn.copy`), and `LISTEN`'s notifications, through a listening connection
> (`conn.listen`). Each entry
> MUST carry a verdict and the reason for it; "deferred" MUST additionally say
> what closing it would take, because a deferral whose cost is unrecorded is
> indistinguishable from an oversight. An entry graduates by being implemented
> and deleted from this list, and a construct absent from both this list and
> the builder is a defect in this rule, not a silent no. Some boundaries are
> recorded beside the construct they bound rather than here: `CONCURRENTLY`
> (`sql.ddl.index-create`), a range type's `CANONICAL` (`sql.ddl.type-range`),
> a sequence's persistence, owner and schema (`sql.ddl.sequence`), a view's
> persistence and `ALTER VIEW` (`sql.ddl.view`), a materialized view's
> storage and `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` (`sql.ddl.materialized-view`),
> `CREATE TABLE AS`'s persistence and storage, `SELECT INTO` and `EXECUTE`
> (`sql.ddl.create-table-as`), a schema's `AUTHORIZATION`, owner and element
> list (`sql.ddl.schema`), a domain's `SET SCHEMA`, owner and named `NOT
> NULL` (`sql.ddl.domain`), COPY TO's column list (`sql.ast.copy`), and
> syntax only PostgreSQL 19 parses (`sql.target`).
>
> Three tests decide which verdict an entry gets. *Does the ORM need it to do
> its job?* — the builder exists to render the statements an entity layer
> issues, so a construct no ORM path emits is out of scope however ordinary it
> is in SQL. *Does the typed form add anything over the raw one?* — a
> construct with no options, no identifiers to quote and no values to bind is
> a string, and wrapping a string in a builder buys nothing. *Is it a
> statement or a vocabulary?* — a whole statement kind costs a new AST node, a
> new renderer and a new `SubQueryStatement` arm; a clause on an existing
> statement costs a field.
>
> **Deferred** — worth building, not built: none at present.
>
> **Out of scope** — not the builder's job:
>
> - **Partitioning DDL** (`PARTITION BY`, `PARTITION OF`, `ATTACH`/`DETACH`).
>   A physical-layout decision made once per table by whoever owns the schema,
>   with a large option surface and no values to bind. Migrations write it as
>   raw SQL.
> - **`EXCLUDE` constraints.** An operator-class-per-column constraint whose
>   typed form would be most of an index builder again, for a constraint an
>   entity layer never generates.
> - **Table and column storage and persistence options** (`WITH (fillfactor =
>   …)`, `TABLESPACE`, `SET STORAGE`, `TEMPORARY`, `UNLOGGED`,
>   `SET { LOGGED | UNLOGGED }`). Physical tuning with no effect on any
>   statement the ORM issues, and no identifier or value that needs quoting.
> - **`GRANT` / `REVOKE`, and roles.** Privileges are an operational concern,
>   granted by whoever administers the database rather than by the process
>   reading from it; a library that can widen its own privileges is a hazard
>   and not a feature.
> - **Triggers and `CREATE FUNCTION`.** Both carry a body in another language
>   (`plpgsql`, `sql`, C), which no expression AST can model — the body is an
>   opaque string however it is delivered, so a builder around it is quoting
>   with extra steps.
> - **Row-level security policies.** Same shape as privileges, and a policy
>   that the application can rewrite is not a security boundary.
> - **Procedural `DO` blocks.** A string of another language, as triggers are.
> - **`CREATE DATABASE` and the other cluster-level statements.** Run once by
>   an operator, outside any transaction and outside the database the
>   application connects to. `CREATE EXTENSION` is built (`sql.ddl.extension`),
>   because an extension is what makes a *column type* available and so is
>   reachable from an entity.
> - **`COPY` to or from a file on the server, and `PROGRAM`.** The server
>   reads or writes the file, or runs the program, as its own operating-system
>   user, which is why PostgreSQL reserves both for superusers and the
>   `pg_read_server_files`, `pg_write_server_files` and
>   `pg_execute_server_program` roles. That is access to the database host
>   rather than to its data, and a library that can widen its own reach is a
>   hazard, as with privileges. The data an application moves travels over its
>   connection, which is what `FROM STDIN` and `TO STDOUT` are (`sql.ast.copy`,
>   `conn.copy`).
> - **`EXPLAIN`.** A diagnostic no ORM path issues, whose result is a plan
>   rather than rows of the entity's shape; `query_raw` sends it with a built
>   statement's text and parameters.
> - **`LOCK TABLE`.** The ORM's locking is row-level, through `SELECT … FOR
>   UPDATE` / `FOR SHARE`, which is built (`sql.render.locking`); a table lock
>   is a statement with a table name and a mode, sent through `execute` inside
>   the transaction it must belong to.
> - **The extension `TABLESAMPLE` methods** (`SYSTEM_ROWS`, `SYSTEM_TIME`).
>   Each exists only once its extension, `tsm_system_rows` or
>   `tsm_system_time`, is installed, and draws by a row count or a time
>   budget rather than a percentage, so no ORM path depends on one;
>   `SampleMethod` builds the two every server has
>   (`sql.ast.select.table-sample`), and `FromItem::Template` reaches these.

## Target release

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.target+1]
> A build of pgorm targets one PostgreSQL major release. 18 is the floor and
> the default: a build that names no release targets 18, there is no `pg-18`
> feature to say so, and nothing older is kept working. The `pg-19` cargo
> feature targets 19. pgorm-query declares it, since the typed surface lives
> there; pgorm forwards it (`pg-19 = ["pgorm-query/pg-19"]`), and so does
> pgorm-python (`pg-19 = ["pgorm/pg-19"]`), whose capability manifest then
> lists `pg-19` among its `features` (`python.capabilities`). No other crate
> carries it, because no other crate's surface or behaviour differs between
> the two releases yet. `pgorm_query::POSTGRES_TARGET` is the release a build
> targets, 18 or 19: a dependent cannot read another crate's features through
> `cfg`, so this is how it learns the target, at compile time if it likes.
>
> The feature is additive, as Cargo requires. Unification turns it on for
> every crate in a build once any one asks, so it MAY add typed surface only
> 19 accepts and MAY change which release's answers the live suite holds, and
> it MUST NOT remove or reshape anything the default build has that 19 still
> accepts. 19-only surface therefore arrives as new items — a type, a method,
> a constructor, or a variant of a `#[non_exhaustive]` public enum, whose
> dependents already match it with an arm for what they do not know
> (`sql.surface`), each marked `doc(cfg(feature = "pg-19"))` — and never as a
> new variant of an exhaustive public enum, a new public field or a changed
> signature, any of which breaks a dependent that compiles today. A builder
> value renders the same SQL under either target: what the server does with
> that SQL is the server's, and a release difference in it is documented
> rather than rendered around.
>
> The type gates what the builder can know. Syntax only 19 parses is
> reachable only under `pg-19`, so code built for 18 cannot construct a
> statement 18 cannot parse. A difference that turns on what the server holds
> — which kind of constraint a name is, which constraints a table has, how
> many rows a subquery returns — is beyond what any builder value records, so
> it is documented per release instead: the rule and the rustdoc give 18's
> answer and 19's, naming each, and the live test holds 18's answer by
> default and 19's under `cfg(feature = "pg-19")` (pgorm-python's tests branch
> on the manifest's `features`). Each build's suite runs against the server it
> targets: `DATABASE_URL` names an 18 server for the default build and a 19
> one for `pg-19`. Three such differences exist today, and no 19-only syntax
> is built yet: `ALTER CONSTRAINT .. ENFORCED` / `NOT ENFORCED` on a `CHECK`
> (`sql.ddl.enforcement`), `SET EXPRESSION` on a virtual column under a
> `CHECK` (`sql.ddl.alter-table`), and `JSON_ARRAY` over a query of no rows
> (`sql.ast.expr.sql-json`).
>
> Every parse pgorm makes stays on PostgreSQL 18's grammar under either target
> until libpg_query releases a 19 one: the render oracle
> (`sql.render.oracle`), `sql!` and `prql!`, codegen's DDL reader, the
> paginator and metric fingerprints. Building 19-only syntax waits for that
> grammar, since every render has to parse, and until it lands `sql!` refuses
> 19-only syntax under `pg-19` too. That work decides how the parsers follow
> the target, and whether pgorm-sql-macro and pgorm-codegen gain the feature
> for it, keeping an 18 build's `sql!` from accepting what 18 cannot parse.

## SELECT statements

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.select+6]
> `SelectStatement` is the SELECT AST node. It accumulates: an optional carried

## Ordering

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.order+3]
> `SelectStatement` and `WindowStatement` — the two statements PostgreSQL
> admits an ORDER BY on — share the `OrderedStatement` trait; the write
> statements do not implement it, per `sql.ast.update` and `sql.ast.delete`.
> Order expressions MUST accumulate in call order via `order_by` (column +
> `Order`), `order_by_expr`, `order_by_columns`, and the `*_with_nulls` variants
> which attach a `NullOrdering` (`First`/`Last`) rendered as `NULLS
> FIRST`/`NULLS LAST`. `clear_order_by` MUST remove all accumulated order
> expressions. There is no raw-string ordering verb: a verbatim SQL fragment
> reaches ORDER BY position only as an `Expr::raw` through `order_by_expr`.
>
> `Order` MUST support `Asc`, `Desc`, and `Field(Values)`; the `Field` variant
> renders a `CASE WHEN col=v_i THEN i ... ELSE n END` expression implementing
> explicit value ordering.

## Conditions

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.condition+1]
> `Condition` is a tree node holding a `condition_type`
> (`ConditionType::All` = conjunction, `ConditionType::Any` = disjunction), a
> `negate` flag, and child `ConditionExpression`s, where each child is either a
> nested `Condition` or a leaf `SimpleExpr`. `Condition::all()` and
> `Condition::any()` construct empty sets; `add` pushes a child; `add_option`
> pushes only when `Some`; `not()` toggles the negate flag; `is_empty`/`len`
> inspect the children. Those constructors are the only spelling — the type
> carries no shorthand alias and no shorthand macro.
>
> The `IntoCondition` trait converts arguments at API boundaries: a
> `SimpleExpr` becomes `Condition::all().add(expr)` and a `Condition` passes
> through unchanged, which is why `and_where`-style helpers and `cond_where`
> accept both.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:sql.ast.condition.flattening]
> `Condition::add` flattens trivial nesting: when the added child is itself a
> `Condition` with exactly one member and no negation, the inner member is
> unwrapped and pushed directly, skipping the useless junction. Nested
> conditions with two or more members, or with `negate` set, are kept intact
> and render inside parentheses.
>
> When a `Condition` is lowered to a `SimpleExpr` (`to_simple_expr`), members
> are folded left-to-right with `OR` for `Any` and `AND` for `All`. An empty
> `Any` lowers to the constant `FALSE` and an empty `All` to the constant
> `TRUE` (as inline `SimpleExpr::Constant`s), and a set with `negate` wraps the
> folded expression in `NOT (...)`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.condition.holder+2]
> WHERE and HAVING clauses are backed by `ConditionHolder`, whose contents are
> an `Option<Condition>`: absent until a condition is added, `Some` thereafter.
> There is exactly one way in — `add_condition`, reached through `cond_where`
> and `cond_having` — so the holder has no second, incompatible representation
> to mix with, and the API surface offers no operation that can fail on it.
> `ConditionalStatement::and_where`, `and_where_option`, and `and_having` are
> shorthands that lift a `SimpleExpr` through `IntoCondition` into
> `Condition::all().add(expr)` and delegate; a chain style built from
> per-link `AND`/`OR` operators is deliberately absent, so the two styles
> cannot disagree about how links combine.
>
> Repeated `cond_where` calls MUST conjoin: if both the current and the added
> condition are non-negated `All` sets the additions are appended flat into the
> existing set; otherwise the current contents and the addition are combined
> under a fresh `Condition::all()`. Order of calls is preserved in the rendered
> output.

## Expressions

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.expr+7]
> `SimpleExpr` is the expression tree node, with variants `Column(ColumnRef)`,
> `Tuple`, `Unary(UnOper, ..)` (the only unary operator is `Not`),

> `Value` (parameterised), `Values`, `Raw(&'static str)` (verbatim SQL),
> `Template(SqlTemplate)`, `Keyword`, `AsEnum`, `Case` and `SimpleCase` (the
> searched and simple forms of `sql.ast.case`), `Subscript` (an array
> subscript or slice, `sql.ast.expr.subscript`), `Grouping` (the
> `GROUPING()` of `sql.ast.select.grouping`), `Constant` (inlined literal),
> `LikePattern` (a `LIKE` pattern with its optional `ESCAPE`), and `SqlJson`
> (an SQL/JSON function, constructor or `IS JSON`, `sql.ast.expr.sql-json`). `SqlTemplate` holds a template with `$1`-style splices
> (`$$` escaping a literal `$`) already resolved against the expressions it
> substitutes; its segments are private and its only constructor is
> `SqlTemplate::new`, which returns `Result`, so the AST cannot hold a template
> whose placeholders and values disagree — see `sql.render.custom-expr`.
>
> `Expr` is the entry-point builder holding a left operand plus pending
> unary/binary operator state; `Expr::col`, `Expr::val`, `Expr::expr`,
> `Expr::tuple`, `Expr::value` and `Expr::raw` construct expressions from
> columns, values, other expressions, and raw SQL — `Expr::raw` bound to
> `&'static str`, so only program text can be written verbatim — and
> `Expr::template`, `Expr::template_with_expr` and `Expr::template_with_exprs`
> do the same for templates, each returning `Result` because each pairs a

> taking the `NamedTable` of `[spec:pgorm:def:sql.types.table-ref+7]` — a name
> with an optional alias, which is the whole of what PostgreSQL's insert target
> admits, so a subquery, values list or function call cannot be inserted into,
> and an alias renders as `INSERT INTO "t" AS "a"`), a
> column list (`columns`, which replaces any previous list), a value source, an
> optional `Overriding`, an optional `OnConflict`, an optional
> `ReturningClause`, an optional WITH clause
> attached by `with(..)` (`query.build.with`), and an optional
> default-values row count. The value source (`InsertValueSource`) is either
> `Values(Vec<Vec<SimpleExpr>>)` — multi-row VALUES accumulated one row per
> `values`/`values_panic` call — or `Select(..)` set by `select_from`, which
> makes the insert read from a query (`INSERT INTO .. SELECT ..`); setting a
> select source replaces any previously accumulated rows.
>
> `or_default_values()` / `or_default_values_many(n)` record a fallback used
> only when no columns and no values were supplied, rendering
> `VALUES (DEFAULT)` repeated `n` times; when columns and values are present
> the fallback is ignored.
>
> `overriding(Overriding)` sets the statement-scoped exemption an identity
> column's generation clause is otherwise absolute about: `SystemValue`
> accepts a supplied value for a `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` column that
> would otherwise raise `428C9`, and `UserValue` discards one supplied to a
> `BY DEFAULT` column. The two are the whole of PostgreSQL's
> `OVERRIDING { SYSTEM | USER } VALUE`, so the slot is a closed pair rather
> than a flag, and the last call wins. It belongs to the *statement* and not to
> the column definition, which is why the exemption can exist at all without
> weakening what `identity()` declares
> (`[spec:pgorm:req:sql.ddl.column-def+5]`): the declaration still refuses every
> insert that does not say this word.

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.insert.arity]
> `values(row)` MUST verify that the row length equals the declared column
> count and return `Err(Error::ColValNumMismatch { col_len, val_len })` on
> mismatch, appending the row only on success. `select_from` MUST apply the
> same check between the column count and the select's projection count.
> `values_panic` and `values_from_panic` are the unwrapping variants and MUST
> panic on the same mismatch.
>
> An empty row passes the check only when zero columns are declared, and is
> then silently discarded (no row appended) — so feeding zero rows leaves the

## ON CONFLICT

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.on-conflict+4]
> `OnConflict` (attached with `InsertStatement::on_conflict`, which accepts
> anything converting into one) MUST be one of exactly two shapes:
> `AnyDoNothing`, carrying nothing, for the arbiter-less clause PostgreSQL
> admits only for `DO NOTHING`; or `Targeted`, pairing a `ConflictArbiter` with
> a `ConflictAction`. There is no third shape, so a clause without an action
> and a `DO UPDATE` without the arbiter PostgreSQL demands for one are both
> unrepresentable per [dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable].
>
> `ConflictArbiter` MUST be one of the grammar's two ways of naming an
> arbiter: `Inference(ConflictTarget)`, the index inference specification,
> or `Constraint(Name)`, a constraint named outright — `ON CONSTRAINT
> "name"`. They are alternatives, not parts of one clause: a column list or a
> `WHERE` after `ON CONSTRAINT` is a syntax error. Each is therefore reached
> through its own builder on the way to an action, and neither builder has
> the other's methods.
>
> `ConflictTarget` MUST hold at least one `ConflictElement` — `Column` or
> `Expr` — plus an optional filter standing for a partial index's predicate.
> `OnConflict::column`/`expr` take the first element and `and_column`,
> `and_columns`, `and_expr`, `and_exprs` add further ones, so the empty target
> list the PostgreSQL grammar rejects has no value to build; the filter lives
> on the target because `ON CONFLICT WHERE ..` with no target is rejected too.
> `and_where`, `and_where_option` and `cond_where` MUST fold into that filter
> through the same merge `sql.ast.condition.holder` specifies.
>
> `OnConflict::columns` MUST name a whole key's columns in one call. It takes
> an `IntoKeyColumns`, the conversion a table key is built from
> (`[spec:pgorm:req:sql.ddl.create-table+16]`): one column or a tuple of one
> to twelve, in order, so `OnConflict::columns((a, b))` is the target
> `column(a).and_column(b)` builds, written the way `.primary_key((a, b))`
> declares the key it arbitrates on. The conversion hands back the first
> column apart from the rest and has no impl for an empty tuple, a slice or a
> `Vec`, so an empty target does not compile; a target whose columns are a
> computed list starts at `column` and extends with `and_columns`. The target
> takes the columns and not a `TableKey`, whose name, `INCLUDE`,
> `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` and deferrability an inference target has no place
> for, and which it would therefore drop. A column named twice is not
> refused: inference matches an index by its set of columns, so the server
> arbitrates `ON CONFLICT (a, b, a)` on the key `(a, b)` as it does
> `(a, b)`, where a table key naming a column twice is refused (`42701`).
>
> `OnConflict::constraint(name)` MUST yield a `ConflictConstraint`, which holds
> the name and nothing else and whose only methods are the transitions to an
> action, so the column list and the predicate that only inference takes are
> unreachable from it; `compile_fail` doctests show both. The name is a bare
> `Name`, quoted like every other identifier, with no schema: the grammar
> spells it as one identifier, because a constraint is looked up on the table
> the statement inserts into. A constraint variant of `ConflictElement` would
> have admitted a constraint beside columns and a constraint under a `WHERE`;
> the typestate admits neither.
>
> `ConflictAction` MUST be either `DoNothing`, carrying nothing, or `Update`
> holding a non-empty `ConflictAssignments` and its own optional filter —
> the action's only filter, because PostgreSQL accepts `WHERE` after
> `DO UPDATE SET ..` and not after `DO NOTHING`, whichever arbiter precedes
> it. Each arbiter's `do_nothing` yields the first; each one's
> `update_column` and `value` take the first assignment and yield a
> `ConflictUpdate`, whose `update_column`/`update_columns` add `Column`
> assignments (rendering `"col" = "excluded"."col"`), whose `value`/`values`
> add `Expr` assignments (rendering `"col" = <expr>`), and whose
> `and_where`/`and_where_option`/`cond_where` fold into the update's filter.
> A `ConflictUpdate` converts into an `OnConflict`, which is how a builder
> chain reaches the statement.
>
> Which constraint a name may reach is the catalogue's to say, not the
> builder's, so the server settles it and the live suite holds each answer.
> A unique or primary-key constraint arbitrates either action, and a
> conflict on any other constraint of the row is still raised (`23505`),
> which is what separates the named clause from the arbiter-less one. An
> exclusion constraint arbitrates `DO NOTHING` and refuses `DO UPDATE`
> (`42809`); it is also the one arbiter that only a name reaches, because
> inference looks for a unique index and finds none (`42P10`). PostgreSQL
> 18's temporal key, a primary or unique key ending `WITHOUT OVERLAPS`
> (`[spec:pgorm:req:sql.ddl.create-table+16]`), is enforced as one and
> arbitrates as one, which the live suite holds: `OnConflict::columns` over

> name takes `DO NOTHING`, an overlapping row being the conflict, and refuses
> `DO UPDATE` (`42809`). A deferrable

> check constraint has no index to arbitrate by (`42809`); and a unique index

## RETURNING

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.returning+3]
> `ReturningClause` expresses PostgreSQL's `RETURNING`: a list, and the names
> the list reads a written row's two versions by. The list has four forms:
> every column of the target (`RETURNING *`), column references, expressions,
> and expressions each under a name (`<expr> AS "<name>"`). The `Returning`
> helper (obtained from `Query::returning()`) constructs a clause in one of
> them via `all()`, `column(..)`, `columns(..)`, `expr(..)`, `exprs(..)`,
> `expr_as(expr, name)` and `exprs_as(pairs)`. A name is the result column's,
> which is how a list reading both versions of a column tells them apart,
> `old."v"` and `new."v"` both being called `v` otherwise; it is a
> caller-supplied identifier, quoted like every other name and registered with
> the identifier oracle (`security.ident-oracle`). Insert, update, and delete
> statements accept a clause through `returning(..)`, with shorthands
> `returning_col(..)` and `returning_all()`, and a MERGE through `returning(..)`
> (`sql.ast.merge`); `SelectStatement` has no RETURNING support. Each call
> replaces any previously set clause.
>
> PostgreSQL 18 lets the list read the row as it was before the write and as
> the statement left it, through the special relations `old` and `new`.
> `ReturningRow` (`Old`, `New`) names them, and paired with a column or with
> `Asterisk` it converts into the `RowColumn` and `RowAsterisk` forms of
> `ColumnRef` (`sql.types.column-ref`), so `(ReturningRow::Old, col)` stands

> - `UPDATE`: `old` is the row before the update, `new` the row after it.

> - `INSERT`, with `VALUES` or `SELECT`: `old` reads NULL in every column,
>   except for a row that `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` updated, whose `old` is the

> walking every expression of the list, so it does not try. The rename is
> the cure. `ReturningClause::old_as(name)` and `new_as(name)` write
> `RETURNING WITH (OLD AS "name", NEW AS "name")`. A renamed version answers
> only to its new name (the keyword then names nothing, `42P01`), so the list
> reads it through an ordinary qualifier, `(name, col)`, which an `alias`
> token makes one value with the declaration. A new name that clashes with
> one of the statement's relations is refused (`42712`) rather than taken, so
> a rename is loud where the default names are silent. Each version holds at
> most one name and the last call wins, so naming `OLD` twice (`42601`)
> cannot be built, and the `WITH` list renders only when it names something,
> so the empty `WITH ()` (`42601`) cannot either. The server refuses one name
> given to both versions (`42712`). The names are caller-supplied
> identifiers, quoted like every other name and registered with the
> identifier oracle (`security.ident-oracle`).

## UPDATE and DELETE statements

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.update+5]
> `UpdateStatement` MUST accumulate SET assignments in call order as
> `(column, expression)` pairs: `values(pairs)` pushes many, `value(col, expr)`
> pushes one, and any `Into<SimpleExpr>` is accepted on the right-hand side
> (values, keywords, `Expr::raw` fragments, subqueries). Duplicate columns are
> not deduplicated — each call appends. The statement also carries the target
> `table` — the `NamedTable` of `[spec:pgorm:def:sql.types.table-ref+7]`, so
> the target is a name with an optional alias and nothing else, rendering
> `UPDATE "t" AS "a" SET ..` when one is bound — a FROM relation list, a WHERE
> `ConditionHolder` (per `sql.ast.condition.holder`), an optional
> `ReturningClause`, and an optional WITH clause attached by `with(..)`
> (`query.build.with`). `get_values` MUST expose the accumulated assignment
> pairs for inspection.
>
> The FROM relation list MUST accumulate through `from(..)`, exactly as
> `sql.ast.select.from` describes for a SELECT, and MUST take the same
> currency: any `IntoFromItem`, so a plain table, an aliased table, a
> subquery, a function call, a values list or a `FromItem::Template` fragment
> all stand where a relation stands. It is a relation *list*, not a join tree:
> the statement holds no `JoinExpr`, so a caller writes the join condition as
> an ordinary WHERE predicate, which is how PostgreSQL's own `UPDATE .. FROM`
> reads and what its documentation recommends. That boundary is a deliberate
> first cut rather than an oversight — `JoinExpr`, `JoinKind` and `JoinOn` are
> `pub(crate)` per `sql.surface`, so joins in the write statements' relation
> lists would mean publishing the join shape and a whole
> `inner_join`/`left_join`/`right_join`/`full_outer_join`/`cross_join` family
> on two more statement types to buy syntax the WHERE already expresses. A
> caller who needs an outer join's null-extension drives the statement from a
> subquery FROM item that performs it.
>
> The statement MUST NOT carry ORDER BY expressions or a LIMIT: PostgreSQL
> admits neither on an UPDATE. `UpdateStatement` therefore does not implement
> `OrderedStatement` and has no `limit` method, so neither clause can be built
> to be rendered; an update over an ordered, limited set of rows is expressed
> by the caller as a subquery filter (`WHERE id IN (SELECT .. ORDER BY ..
> LIMIT ..)`). A FROM relation does not substitute for that: it widens what
> the statement can read, not how many rows it touches.

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.delete+4]
> `DeleteStatement` is the DELETE AST node: a target table set by
> `from_table` — the `NamedTable` of `[spec:pgorm:def:sql.types.table-ref+7]`,
> a name with an optional alias, rendering `DELETE FROM "t" AS "a"` when one is
> bound — a USING relation list, a WHERE `ConditionHolder` shared with the
> condition rules, and an optional `ReturningClause`. Like the other three
> statements it carries an optional WITH clause, attached by `with(..)`
> (`query.build.with`).
>
> USING is DELETE's spelling of UPDATE's FROM and MUST behave identically:
> `using(..)` accumulates a relation list of any `IntoFromItem`, carries no
> join tree, and leaves the join condition to WHERE, with the boundary
> `sql.ast.update` states. The two clauses differ in keyword only because
> PostgreSQL's grammar does — `FROM` is already spoken for on a DELETE by the
> target table — so a single `FromItem` list serves both and one rendering
> rule covers the pair.
>
> As with `sql.ast.update`, the statement MUST NOT carry ORDER BY expressions
> or a LIMIT — PostgreSQL admits neither on a DELETE — so it implements no
> `OrderedStatement` and offers no `limit`, and an ordered or limited delete is
> written as a subquery filter over a SELECT.

## MERGE statements

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.merge+1]
> `MergeStatement` is the MERGE AST node. It holds a target `NamedTable`
> (`[spec:pgorm:def:sql.types.table-ref+7]`: a name, bare or
> schema-qualified, with an optional alias), an `only` flag, a source
> `FromItem`, the join condition, an optional plain `WithClause`, its
> `WHEN` arms, and an optional RETURNING list. `Query::merge(target, source,
> on)` takes the three required
> parts: any `IntoNamedTable`, any `IntoFromItem` (a table, a subquery, a
> values list, a function call or a template fragment, the currency of
> `sql.ast.select.from`) and any `IntoCondition`. It returns a
> `PendingMerge`, which is not a statement: it implements neither
> `QueryStatementBuilder` nor `Display`. Each of its six methods
> (`when_matched`, `when_matched_and`, `when_not_matched`,
> `when_not_matched_and`, `when_not_matched_by_source` and
> `when_not_matched_by_source_and`) adds the first arm and returns the
> `MergeStatement`, so a MERGE with no WHEN clause (`42601`) has no
> constructor. `MergeStatement` has the same six methods as `&mut self`
> builders, plus `with(WithClause)`, `only()`, `returning(ReturningClause)`
> and `returning_action()`.
>
> There are three kinds of row, as in PostgreSQL 17's grammar: a target row
> the join condition paired with a source row (*matched*), a source row it
> paired with no target row (*not matched*, which PostgreSQL also spells
> `NOT MATCHED BY TARGET`), and a target row it paired with no source row
> (*not matched by source*). An arm's action MUST be typed by the kind of
> row the arm takes. `when_matched*` and `when_not_matched_by_source*` take
> any `Into<MatchedAction>`, the actions on a target row: `Update(MergeUpdate)`,
> `Delete` or `DoNothing`. `when_not_matched*` takes any
> `Into<NotMatchedAction>`: `Insert(MergeInsert)`, `InsertDefaultValues` or
> `DoNothing`. So an INSERT for a target row and an UPDATE or DELETE for an
> unmatched source row, each `42601`, do not typecheck, and `compile_fail`
> doctests show all three. A not-matched-by-source row has no source row,
> so its arm's condition and its update can read only the target; a
> reference to the source there is refused (`42P01`), which the expression
> types cannot see, so the server settles it as it settles the target
> reference a not-matched arm's condition may not make. `MergeUpdate` and `MergeInsert` hold `(column, expression)`
> pairs and are non-empty by construction: `value(col, expr)` takes the
> first pair, and `and_value` and `and_values` append further pairs in
> order. The pairing keeps an insert's column list and its `VALUES` row the
> same length, which a separate list and row could break, so the positional
> `INSERT VALUES (..)` with no column list is not offered. A column is a bare
> `Name`: PostgreSQL resolves it against the target and refuses one
> qualified by the table (`42703`). `MergeInsert::overriding` sets
> `OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE` or `OVERRIDING USER VALUE`, and the last call
> wins. It is reachable on the values form only, because
> `INSERT OVERRIDING .. DEFAULT VALUES` is `42601`.
>
> Each kind's arms MUST be held as its conditional arms in call order,
> followed by at most one unconditional arm. A row takes the first
> conditional arm of its kind whose condition holds, so the order is part of
> the statement's meaning, and the unconditional arm takes the rows they
> leave. PostgreSQL refuses an arm after an unconditional arm of the same
> kind as unreachable (`42601`), for each of the three kinds. That error is
> raised in parse analysis, so libpg_query alone would accept the statement.
> This builder cannot represent it: `when_matched`, `when_not_matched` and
> `when_not_matched_by_source` set the kind's one unconditional arm, the last
> call wins, and the arm renders after the kind's conditional arms whenever
> it was added. The kinds never compete for a row, so holding them apart
> changes nothing.
>
> `returning` sets the RETURNING list, a `ReturningClause`
> (`sql.ast.returning`), and the last call wins. The list reads the source
> row and the target row, whose two versions `ReturningRow` names. A column
> named bare resolves against both relations, so a name both have is
> ambiguous (`42702`) and is qualified by its table or alias, and `*` is the
> source's columns followed by the target's. A target column reads the row
> the merge left, or the deleted row as it was; `old` reads NULL in every
> column of an inserted row and `new` in every column of a deleted one; a
> row an arm left alone with `DO NOTHING` is not returned. `returning_action()` adds `merge_action()` as the list's first
> column, the text `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` naming the action the row
> took, and with no list it is the list. That method is the only constructor
> of `merge_action()`. PostgreSQL resolves the function in a MERGE's
> RETURNING list (a subquery within the list included) and refuses it
> anywhere else, a `WHEN` condition, another statement's RETURNING or a
> SELECT (`42601`). An expression variant would place it anywhere, so the
> builder has none, and it cannot be written outside a MERGE's list.
> `Func::named("merge_action")` does not reach it either: the name is a
> keyword PostgreSQL restricts, so the function-name policy quotes it, and
> the quoted name is no function (`42883`).
>
> `with` takes a `WithClause` rather than `AnyWithClause`, because
> PostgreSQL refuses `WITH RECURSIVE` on a MERGE (`42601`). A data-modifying
> common table expression is accepted. `only()` writes `ONLY` before the
> target, so the rows of tables that inherit from it are neither matched nor
> written.
>
> Every value travels through the bound-parameter pipeline of
> `sql.ast.build`, whether it sits in the join condition, an arm's
> condition, an assignment or the inserted row. The server types such a
> parameter by the column it is assigned to or compared with. A value in the
> source relation is assigned to no column, so a bound `VALUES` row or
> function argument has only the type an unknown parameter gets. Annotating
> it is the caller's obligation under `sql.render.placeholder-typing`, and
> the live suite holds both refusals (`42883`, `42725`).
>
> A MERGE nests as a common table expression's body (`sql.ast`). No ORM path
> emits MERGE. The upsert an entity layer writes is `ON CONFLICT`
> (`sql.ast.on-conflict`). A caller runs a MERGE by building it and
> executing the `(String, Values)` pair, and with a RETURNING list reads the
> rows it wrote.

## COPY statements

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.copy+2]
> `CopyFromStatement<F>` (`COPY … FROM STDIN`) and `CopyToStatement<F>`
> (`COPY … TO STDOUT`) are the COPY AST nodes: the statements that open
> COPY's data flow, which `conn.copy` runs. Each is made by `new` with what
> PostgreSQL cannot do without. `CopyFromStatement::new(table, format)` takes
> the table, any `IntoTableName`, bare or schema-qualified.
> `CopyToStatement::new(source, format)` takes its source, any
> `IntoCopySource`, which converts into a `CopySource`: a table, or the rows
> of one of the five statements `IntoSubQueryStatement` covers (`sql.ast`),
> a `SELECT`'s or a write's `RETURNING` list. PostgreSQL refuses a write
> without one there (`0A000`), when the COPY starts. A COPY TO over one MUST
> NOT be buildable. `CopySource`'s contents are private, so it holds only
> what a conversion into it accepted. A table name and a `SELECT` are
> `IntoCopySource`. An INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE, or a
> `SubQueryStatement`, converts through `CopySource`'s `TryFrom`, which
> refuses a write with no `RETURNING` list as
> `Error::CopyWithoutReturning`, naming the write. A write is no
> `IntoCopySource`, so handing one to `new` directly is a compile error. A
> MERGE's `returning_action` is a `RETURNING` list by itself. The check reads
> the source statement's own clauses, as the server's does: a `SELECT` whose
> data-modifying CTE returns nothing is a source, the server running that
> CTE as it runs one in any query (`sql.ast.with`). Neither statement is a
> `SubQueryStatement` or a `QueryStatementBuilder`: COPY nests nowhere, and it
> binds nothing, so its rendering is `Display` alone (`sql.render.copy`).
>
> A `SELECT` source carries what the server refuses of any `SELECT` when the
> COPY starts: a tie limit with no ORDER BY or beside `SKIP LOCKED`
> (`sql.ast.select.tie-limit`), and a WINDOW clause, or a reference to one,
> that it refuses (`sql.ast.window-statement`). A `SELECT` converts into a
> source infallibly, so the conversion does not check it.
> `CopyToStatement::check_source` runs the source's `check_tie_limit` and
> `check_windows`, and finds nothing to refuse in a table or a write, and every
> pgorm executor of a COPY TO and the Python and JavaScript builders run those
> checks before it renders (`conn.copy`, `[dec:pgorm:no-panic]`). A source is
> final once converted, so the `SELECT` checked is the one that renders.
> Rendering is infallible, as a `SELECT`'s is, so a caller of pgorm-query alone
> who skips the check sends SQL the server refuses. The check reads the
> source's own clauses: a `SELECT` nested in it, a write's included, is the
> server's refusal.
>
> The format is the statement's type parameter, chosen at construction from
> the closed set PostgreSQL 18 has: `CopyText`, `CopyCsv` and `CopyBinary`,
> unit types implementing the sealed `CopyFormat`; `CopyDelimitedFormat`, also
> sealed, marks the two text formats. An option MUST be a method only where
> the server accepts it in that direction and that format, so a combination
> it refuses has no spelling:
>
> - Every COPY FROM: a column list (`columns`, which a later call extends;
>   none supplies every column in the table's order), `FREEZE` (`freeze`), and
>   a `WHERE` through `ConditionalStatement`.
> - Text and CSV, both directions: `DELIMITER`, `NULL`, `HEADER` and `ENCODING`
>   (`delimiter`, `null_string`, `header`, `encoding`). COPY FROM adds
>   `DEFAULT` (`default_string`), `HEADER MATCH` (`header_match`) and
>   `ON_ERROR ignore` (`on_error_ignore`).
> - CSV, both directions: `QUOTE` and `ESCAPE` (`quote`, `escape`). COPY FROM
>   adds `FORCE_NOT_NULL` and `FORCE_NULL`, COPY TO adds `FORCE_QUOTE`, each over
>   named columns or over every column (`*`, the `_all` method).
> - Binary takes none of the text options. The server refuses `HEADER`,
>   `NULL`, `DEFAULT` and `ON_ERROR ignore` in binary mode (`0A000`), and
>   accepts `ENCODING` there without it changing a byte that is sent, so the
>   type leaves that out as well.
>
> `ON_ERROR stop` is the server's default and has no value, as `NOT
> DEFERRABLE` has none (`conn.tx`): selecting it says nothing. `CopyIgnore`
> carries the two options that mean nothing without `ignore`, so neither can be
> written without it: `REJECT_LIMIT`, a `NonZeroU32` because the server refuses
> zero, and `LOG_VERBOSITY` (`CopyLogVerbosity::Verbose` or `Silent`; no value
> is the server's default).
>
> COPY TO has no column list. `COPY t (a, b) TO STDOUT` copies what `COPY
> (SELECT a, b FROM t) TO STDOUT` copies, and the query form can also filter,
> order and join, so a subset of a table's columns is a `SELECT`.
>
> What turns on a value or on the catalog is left to the server, which
> refuses it when `conn.copy` starts the statement: a delimiter, quote or
> escape that is not a single one-byte character (`0A000`), a delimiter the
> text format reserves or a newline (`22023`), `NULL` and `DEFAULT` strings
> that are equal or hold the delimiter (`22023`), a forced column the COPY
> does not name (`42P10`), an encoding the server does not know (`22023`), and
> `FREEZE` on a table not created or truncated in the current subtransaction
> (`55000`). An empty forced-column list is no option at all: `FORCE_QUOTE ()`
> is a syntax error, and forcing no column is the option left out. COPY to or
> from a file on the server, and through `PROGRAM`, is not built
> (`sql.scope`).

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.copy.parts]
> A COPY statement's parts are read back through getters, so what a COPY
> carries can be described without rendering it (`conn.copy.rows`):
> `CopyFromStatement::get_table` and `get_columns`, its table and its column
> list, empty when it names none; and `CopyToStatement::get_source`, its
> `CopySource`, whose `get_table` and `get_query` give the table or the
> statement it reads, the other `None`. They borrow: nothing a getter returns
> changes the statement, so a source still holds only what its conversion
> accepted.

## WITH clauses and CTEs
## WITH clauses and CTEs

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.with+5]
> `CommonTableExpression` defines one named query in a WITH clause and MUST be
> complete the moment it exists: `CommonTableExpression::new(table_name, query)`
> takes both mandatory parts. The query is any statement implementing
> `IntoSubQueryStatement`, stored as a `SubQueryStatement`, a MERGE included
> (`sql.ast`). The AST does not restrict INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE CTEs;
> validity is left to PostgreSQL, which runs a write CTE without RETURNING
> and refuses only a read of it (`0A000`), and refuses a write CTE below
> the top level (`0A000`). Only the genuinely optional parts remain
> builder methods: the column list (`column`/`columns`) and the `materialized`
> flag rendering `MATERIALIZED` / `NOT MATERIALIZED`.
> `CommonTableExpression::from_select` derives a CTE from a `SelectStatement`,
> naming it `cte_<table>` after the first FROM table and deriving column names
> from aliases or plain column projections; it returns `Option<Self>`, yielding
> `None` when the select has no FROM table to take a name from rather than
> producing a nameless CTE. `try_set_cols_from_select` performs only the column
> derivation and reports `false` (leaving columns untouched) when any projection
> is an expression or wildcard it cannot name.
>
> The two shapes a WITH clause can take are distinct types rather than a
> `recursive` flag. `WithClause` is the non-recursive form and holds a non-empty
> CTE collection: `WithClause::new(cte)` takes the first, `cte` appends further
> ones, and `ctes` iterates them in order. `RecursiveWithClause` is the
> recursive form, described by `sql.ast.with.recursive`. `AnyWithClause` is the
> closed sum of the two. `Into<AnyWithClause>` is what `stmt.with(clause)`
> accepts on each of select, insert, update and delete, and
> `MergeStatement::with` accepts the plain `WithClause` alone
> (`query.build.with`). Those setters are the only ways a clause reaches a
> statement.
>
> A clause has exactly one home, the statement that carries it. There is no
> wrapper type holding a clause plus the statement it prefixes, and therefore no
> `WithBody` bound to keep a select out of one: the invalid state that bound
> guarded is unconstructible because the second home no longer exists
> (`query.build.with.single`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.with.recursive+1]
> The recursive WITH form MUST be a distinct type, `RecursiveWithClause`, whose
> single `CommonTableExpression` is taken by `RecursiveWithClause::new` — a
> recursive WITH consists of exactly one CTE containing a union query, and the
> multi-CTE recursive clause is therefore not constructible. It renders
> `WITH RECURSIVE` and carries the optional `SEARCH` (`search`) and `CYCLE`
> (`cycle`) clauses, which only this form accepts, so no setting can be
> silently ignored. Neither this type nor `WithClause` can be built empty, so
> rendering asserts nothing and MUST NOT panic on any clause a caller can
> construct.
>
> `Search::new(order, expr, alias)` pairs a `SearchOrder` (`BREADTH`/`DEPTH`)
> with the expression tracking the path and the name of the generated order
> column; the name is a constructor argument rather than an optional alias on a
> `SelectExpr`, so the missing-alias failure cannot arise. `Cycle::new(expr,
> set, using)` likewise requires the node-identifying expression, the cycle-mark
> column name, and the path column name at construction, rendering
> `CYCLE <expr> SET <set> USING <using>`.

## Window statements

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.window-statement+8]
> `WindowStatement` describes an OVER window: PARTITION BY expressions
> (`partition_by`, and the `OverStatement` trait's
> `partition_by_columns`), ORDER BY expressions (shared
> `OrderedStatement` trait), and an optional `FrameClause`, set by
> `frame(f)` from anything `Into<FrameClause>`; a second call replaces the
> first.
>
> `FrameType` is all three of PostgreSQL's frame modes — `Range`, `Rows`,
> `Groups` — because the offset means something different under each and none
> of the three is expressible through the others: `Rows` counts rows, `Range`
> counts a distance in the ordering column's own values, and `Groups` counts
> whole peer groups, so `GROUPS 1 PRECEDING` reaches back past every row tied
> with the one before.
>
> A frame is begun from its mode, and its start is typed by the side of the
> current row it lies on, because PostgreSQL's grammar refuses every frame
> whose end comes before its start and none of those MUST construct
> (`[dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable]`). `FrameType`'s four methods
> name the start — `unbounded_preceding()`, `preceding(offset)`,
> `current_row()`, `following(offset)`, and no `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` — and
> return a `FrameStart<S>`, whose marker `S` is `FramePreceding`,
> `FrameCurrentRow` or `FrameFollowing`. Its `and_*` methods give the frame an
> end, `BETWEEN <start> AND <end>`, and each side offers only the ends that may
> follow it: after a preceding start `and_preceding(offset)`,
> `and_current_row()`, `and_following(offset)` and `and_unbounded_following()`;
> after `CURRENT ROW` all but `and_preceding`; after a following start only
> `and_following` and `and_unbounded_following`. A preceding or current-row
> start also stands alone as a whole frame, converting into a `FrameClause`,
> and a following start does not, because PostgreSQL reads a lone start as
> running to the current row, which lies behind it. `ROWS UNBOUNDED
> FOLLOWING`, `… AND UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`, `BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1
> PRECEDING`, `BETWEEN 1 FOLLOWING AND CURRENT ROW` and `ROWS 1 FOLLOWING`
> therefore have no construction. The public `Frame` enum, which could spell
> all five, is gone; the bound is the crate's own `FrameBound`.
>
> An offset is any `Into<SimpleExpr>`, not a count, because under `Range` it is
> a value of the type PostgreSQL pairs with the ordering column's — an
> `interval` over a timestamp, a `numeric` over a numeric — which a count
> cannot spell. The builder does not know the ordering column's type, so the
> pairing is the server's to check, and these refusals are the server's: an
> offset whose type the column's does not pair with (`0A000` under `Range`,
> and `42804` under `Rows` and `Groups`, whose offsets are `bigint` counts); a
> `Range` offset in a window without exactly one ORDER BY column (`42P20`); a
> `Groups` frame in a window with no ORDER BY (`42P20`); an offset that reads a
> column (`42P10`); and a negative one (`22013`). A bound offset is a `$N` the
> server types from the same pairing — `interval`, `numeric` or `bigint` — so
> a text value bound where it expects an `interval` fails at bind, and the
> offset is spelled with a cast (`sql.render.placeholder-typing`).
>
> `FrameClause::exclude(e)` adds the `EXCLUDE` clause, `FrameExclusion` being
> `CurrentRow`, `Group`, `Ties` or `NoOthers`; a second call replaces the
> first, and a lone start has the same method. The clause is grammatical only
> inside a frame, and it is a method of the frame rather than of the window,
> so a window without a frame has nothing to call it on. Each exclusion is
> relative to the current row's peers — the rows the window's ORDER BY ties
> with it — so `Group` and `Ties` differ from `CurrentRow` only where the
> ordering ties, and `NoOthers` removes nothing: it is the default, spelled.

> `WindowFunction` rather than anything convertible to `SimpleExpr` (per
> `[dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable]`): a windowed column reference,

> constructors are the only source of a windowed one — so the pairing cannot
> be taken apart by mutating a projection in place. The alias stays writable:
> renaming a projection cannot invalidate the pairing.

## CASE expressions

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.case+2]
> PostgreSQL's two CASE forms are two types, because their arms have two
> shapes and a CASE mixing them has no spelling.
>
> `CaseStatement` builds the searched form: each `case(cond, then)` call
> appends a `WHEN <condition> THEN <result>` arm — the condition is any
> `IntoCondition`, so `Condition` trees render with their `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`
> structure inside the WHEN — and `finally(expr)` sets the optional `ELSE`
> result. `Expr::case(cond, then)` is its only constructor and takes the first
> arm, so a searched CASE holds at least one arm from the start: there is no
> armless `new()` and no `Default`. A `CaseStatement` converts into
> `SimpleExpr::Case`.
>
> `SimpleCaseStatement` builds the simple form, `CASE <operand> WHEN <value>
> THEN <result> … END`, whose arms hold *values* the one operand is compared
> with. `Expr::case_of(operand)` takes the operand and returns a
> `CaseOperand`, whose only method, `when(value, then)`, adds the first arm
> and yields the `SimpleCaseStatement`; that type's own `when` appends further
> arms in call order and `finally(expr)` sets the `ELSE`. Neither type offers
> the other's arm method, so a condition arm cannot join an operand CASE nor a
> value arm a searched one. The operand is a constructor argument rather than
> an optional field beside the arms, and the first arm is a step rather than a
> default: PostgreSQL's grammar requires at least one `WHEN`, so `CaseOperand`
> does not convert into an expression, and a simple CASE with no arm has no
> value to build. A `SimpleCaseStatement` converts into `SimpleExpr::SimpleCase`.
>
> The simple form is not an abbreviation of a searched CASE over `IS NULL`
> tests. Each arm is the comparison `operand = value`, which is unknown when
> either side is NULL, so a NULL operand matches no arm — `WHEN NULL`
> included — and yields the `ELSE`, or NULL without one; the searched form's
> `WHEN x IS NULL` is the spelling that catches it.
>
> Either form can be projected (with `expr_as`), compared, nested in the
> other's results, or used anywhere an expression is accepted. Neither can be
> built without a `WHEN` — the searched form's constructor takes the first arm
> and the simple form's operand step converts into nothing — so `(CASE END)`
> and `(CASE ELSE … END)`, which the grammar rejects, have no construction
> (`[dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable]`).

## Casts

> [spec:pgorm:req:sql.ast.cast-shape+2]
> A cast has exactly ONE node shape: `SimpleExpr::AsEnum(TypeName, operand)`.
> Every spelling that produces one — `as_enum`, `cast_as`, `cast_as_type`
> (on `Expr` and on `SimpleExpr`), `as_range`
> (`[spec:pgorm:def:sql.value.created-range]`), the entity layer's enum and
> created-range casts, and the `cast_as_raw` escape hatch — builds
> that node, and there is no `Function::Cast`. Whether the type renders as a
> quoted identifier or as the caller's own verbatim text is carried *inside*
> the `TypeName` (`[spec:pgorm:def:sql.types.type-name+8]`), never by choosing
> a different node.
>
> What this forbids is the second, `FunctionCall`-shaped cast whose type rode
> as a `SimpleExpr::Raw` operand, and it forbids it for two reasons.
> A consumer reading a cast back off an expression must recognise one shape
> rather than enumerate them: `source_read_cast` recognising only the
> structured shape is why a `#[pgorm(select_as = "…")]` column's read cast
> was silently dropped, so the graph and pipeline decoded the column's stored
> type instead of its cast one — a defect no test of either shape alone could
> have found. And raw text in expression position is an injection site by
> construction; confining verbatim type text to one field of `TypeName`, set
> only by `TypeName::raw` and only from a `&'static str`, makes the places that
> can emit an unescaped type name a finite list that inspection can enumerate:
> the callers of `TypeName::raw`, `cast_as_raw` among them.

## Function calls

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.func+11]
> `FunctionCall` pairs a `Function` selector with argument expressions and
> per-argument modifiers (`FuncArgMod { distinct }`); `arg` appends one
> argument, `args` replaces the argument list. `get_func()` and `get_args()`
> read the two back, and `is_plain()` says the call carries nothing else — no
> `DISTINCT` argument and no aggregate clause — which is what a reader that
> rebuilds a call from those two needs to know (`codegen.entity.transform`). The `Function` enum covers the
> built-ins with typed constructors on the `Func` helper: aggregates `max`,
> `min`, `sum`, `avg`, `count`, `count_distinct` (the DISTINCT argument
> modifier), `bit_and`, `bit_or`; the ordered-set aggregates
> `percentile_cont` and `percentile_disc`; scalar helpers `abs`,
> `char_length`, `if_null`, `coalesce`, `lower`, `upper`, `round`,
> `round_with_precision`, `random`, `starts_with`, `gen_random_uuid`; the
> PostgreSQL full-text family `to_tsquery`, `to_tsvector`,
> `phraseto_tsquery`, `plainto_tsquery`, `websearch_to_tsquery` (each with an
> optional `regconfig` OID prepended as first argument), `ts_rank`,
> `ts_rank_cd`; array/subquery comparators `any`, `some`, `all`; the
> set-returning `generate_series`, `generate_series_step` and `unnest`
> (`sql.ast.select.table-function`); the record-returning `json_to_record`,
> `jsonb_to_record`, `json_to_recordset` and `jsonb_to_recordset`, which a
> column definition list gives their columns
> (`sql.ast.select.column-definitions`); and PostgreSQL 18's UUID family,
> below.
>
> The UUID family is `uuidv4()`, `uuidv7()`, `uuidv7_shifted(shift)`,
> `uuid_extract_timestamp(u)` and `uuid_extract_version(u)` (`func_uuid.rs`),
> rendering `UUIDV4`, `UUIDV7`, `UUID_EXTRACT_TIMESTAMP` and
> `UUID_EXTRACT_VERSION`. `uuidv4` is PostgreSQL 18's name for what
> `gen_random_uuid` returns, and both stay: `gen_random_uuid` is the spelling
> every release since 13 resolves. `uuidv7` mints a time-ordered UUID whose
> leading 48 bits are the Unix time in milliseconds; the live suite holds that
> values a session mints sort strictly in the order it minted them, even
> within one millisecond, so a `uuidv7()` column default fills a key that
> indexes like a sequence. A column takes one as its
> `DEFAULT` the way it takes any expression, `ColumnDef::default(Func::uuidv7())`
> (`[spec:pgorm:req:sql.ddl.column-def+12]`), and an entity as
> `#[pgorm(default_expr = "Func::uuidv7()")]`, `Func` being a prelude member for
> that reason (`[spec:pgorm:def:entity.prelude+8]`). `uuidv7_shifted` is
> `uuidv7`'s one-argument overload, which moves the embedded time by an
> `interval` and binds it as any argument is bound; PostgreSQL has no other
> `uuidv7` arity (`uuidv7(1)` is `42883`). The two readers are immutable, so
> they can stand in an expression index or a generated column, and each answers
> `NULL` rather than failing where it has nothing to read: the timestamp, at
> millisecond precision, only for a version 7 or version 1 UUID, and the
> version only for a UUID of the RFC 9562 variant.
>
> Beyond its arguments a call carries the two clauses PostgreSQL admits after
> them, each optional and each empty by default:
>
> - A FILTER condition, set by `filter(cond)` taking any `IntoCondition`.
>   Each call REPLACES the previous one rather than accumulating — a
>   conjunction is a single `Condition`, so accumulation would give one
>   meaning two spellings and make `filter` the only builder method on the
>   type whose second call means something other than its first.
> - A WITHIN GROUP ordering, a `Vec<OrderExpr>` accumulated by
>   `within_group(col, order)` and `within_group_expr(expr, order)`, mirroring
>   `order_by` / `order_by_expr` of `sql.ast.order`. It accumulates because
>   the hypothetical-set aggregates rank against several columns at once.
>   `OrderExpr`'s fields are not public, so these constructors are the only
>   way to build the payload and there is no list-taking form to offer.
>
> The pair is stored as one `Option<Box<..>>` rather than as two inline
> fields, and that is a size decision rather than a stylistic one.
> `SimpleExpr::FunctionCall` holds a `FunctionCall` inline, and `SelectExpr`,
> `Search` and `Cycle` hold a `SimpleExpr` inline in turn, so every byte here

>
> A cast is not among them. `CAST` is written by `SimpleExpr::AsEnum`

> `json_objectagg`, `json_arrayagg`, `json`, `json_scalar` and

## SQL/JSON

> [spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.expr.sql-json+2]
> PostgreSQL's SQL/JSON — the query functions `JSON_EXISTS`, `JSON_VALUE` and
> `JSON_QUERY`, the constructors `JSON_OBJECT`, `JSON_ARRAY` (over values or
> over a one-column query), `JSON_OBJECTAGG`, `JSON_ARRAYAGG`, `JSON()`,
> `JSON_SCALAR()` and `JSON_SERIALIZE()`, and the `IS [NOT] JSON` predicate —
> is one expression node, `SimpleExpr::SqlJson(Box<SqlJson>)`, whose `SqlJson`
> enum has a variant per form. They are not `FunctionCall`s: their clauses
> (`PASSING`, `RETURNING`, wrapper and quotes behaviour, `ON EMPTY` /
> `ON ERROR`, `ON NULL`, `WITH UNIQUE KEYS`, `FORMAT JSON`) are grammar between
> the parentheses, which `Func::named`'s argument list cannot spell. Each form
> is built by a `Func` constructor returning its own builder, as `Func::grouping`
> returns a `Grouping` (`[spec:pgorm:def:sql.ast.func+10]`): `json_exists`,
> `json_value` and `json_query` take a context item and a path; `json_object()`
> and `json_array()` start empty; `json_array_query(select)`,
> `json_objectagg(key, value)`, `json_arrayagg(value)`, `json(input)` and
> `json_serialize(input)` take their operands; `json_scalar(expr)`, which has
> no clause at all, returns the `SimpleExpr` directly. `IS JSON` is
> `Expr::is_json(test)` and `Expr::is_not_json(test)`, where a `JsonTest` is a
> `JsonKind` (`Value`, `Scalar`, `Array`, `Object`), optionally
> `.with_unique_keys()`. The builders' fields are crate-private, so a value of
> each form holds only what its builder could set.
>
> **Paths are values.** The path of the three query functions is any
> `Into<String>` and is bound, never written into the statement's text
> (`sql.render.sql-json`); PostgreSQL accepts a parameter there. Where the
> server's grammar demands a literal instead — `JSON_TABLE`'s paths
> (`sql.ast.json-table`) — the path is a literal escaped by the value
> pipeline, not interpolated.
>
> **A JSON input** — a context item, a `PASSING` value, a constructor's value,
> the operand of `JSON()` and `JSON_SERIALIZE()` — is a `JsonInput`: any
> expression, and whether it is marked `FORMAT JSON`, which
> `Expr::format_json()` sets. `FORMAT JSON` makes a `text` value embed as the
> JSON it spells rather than as a JSON string, and lets a `bytea` value be read
> as JSON at all (unmarked, the server cannot cast `bytea` to `jsonb`). PostgreSQL
> reads JSON only as UTF-8, so `ENCODING UTF8` is never written: it is
> refused on a `text` value (`42804`) and changes nothing on `bytea`. A
> non-string operand marked `FORMAT JSON` is refused (`42804`); the builder
> does not know an expression's type, so that check is the server's.
>
> **`PASSING`** names a path variable: `passing(value, name)` binds `value`
> as `$name`. The name is an identifier, quoted like every other
> (`security.ident-oracle`), so the path's `$name` matches it exactly as
> written — a quoted name does not fold. PostgreSQL accepts a name given
> twice and a variable the path never reads; a variable the path reads and no
> `PASSING` names fails when the path is evaluated.
>
> **Behaviours are typed per function**, because the set each takes differs
> and the server refuses the rest (`42601`, "invalid ON ERROR behavior"):
>
> - `JSON_EXISTS` takes only `ON ERROR`, a `JsonExistsBehavior` — `True`,
>   `False`, `Unknown`, `Error`. Finding nothing is `false`, not an error, so it
>   has no `ON EMPTY` (`42601`), and it has no `RETURNING` (`42601`).
> - `JSON_VALUE` takes `on_empty` and `on_error`, each a `JsonValueBehavior` —
>   `Null`, `Error`, `Default(Value)`.
> - `JSON_QUERY` takes `on_empty` and `on_error`, each a `JsonQueryBehavior` —
>   those three, `EmptyArray` and `EmptyObject`. `EMPTY` alone means
>   `EMPTY ARRAY` and is not a second spelling here.
>
> Each behaviour is a slot a later call replaces, and `ON EMPTY` always renders
> before `ON ERROR`, so neither the reversed order nor a repeated clause
> (`42601`) can be built. Without a behaviour the server answers `false`
> (`JSON_EXISTS`) or `NULL`. A `Default` holds a `Value`, not an expression:
> PostgreSQL admits only a constant, a function call or an operator expression
> there and refuses a parameter (`42804`, "can only specify a constant,
> non-aggregate function, or operator expression for DEFAULT"), so the value
> is written as an escaped literal (`sql.render.sql-json`), and the server
> converts it to the `RETURNING` type — failing at parse time when it cannot
> (`22P02` for `'abc'` as `integer`; `42846` for an `integer` default to
> `jsonb`).
>
> **`JSON_QUERY`'s result shaping** is one slot: `with_wrapper()` (`WITH
> UNCONDITIONAL WRAPPER`, always an array), `with_conditional_wrapper()`
> (`WITH CONDITIONAL WRAPPER`, an array only when the path finds several
> items — one item, scalar or not, comes back as it is) and `omit_quotes()`
> (`OMIT QUOTES`, a scalar string without its quotes). The last call wins,
> because PostgreSQL refuses `OMIT QUOTES` beside either wrapper (`42601`,
> "SQL/JSON QUOTES behavior must not be specified when WITH WRAPPER is used").
> The defaults `WITHOUT WRAPPER` and `KEEP QUOTES` are never spelled, since an
> absent clause says them; without a wrapper, a path finding several items is
> an error. An unquoted string must still be a value of the returned type —
> `x` is `text` but no `jsonb`, so it fails and `ON ERROR` decides.
> `JSON_VALUE` has neither clause (`42601`).
>
> **`RETURNING`** takes a `ColumnType`, the type vocabulary a column is
> declared in, on every form that has one but `JSON_VALUE`: `JSON_QUERY`
> (default `jsonb`), the four constructors and two aggregates (default
> `json`) and `JSON_SERIALIZE` (default `text`; only a string type or `bytea`,
> `42804` otherwise). `JSON()` and `JSON_SCALAR()` take none (`42601`) and
> return `json`. `JSON_VALUE` (default `text`) takes a `JsonValueType`, which
> is `ColumnType`'s variants without `Json` and `JsonBinary`, each converting
> into its namesake; `TryFrom<ColumnType>` converts a type chosen at run time
> and hands those two back. They are left out because PostgreSQL 18.6 returns
> them wrongly (bug #19695): once one evaluation of `JSON_VALUE .. RETURNING
> jsonb` or `RETURNING json` is `NULL` — a JSON `null`, a path that finds
> nothing or fails, a `NULL` context item — every later evaluation of it in the
> statement is `NULL`, because the executor converts those two types without
> clearing the null flag the previous answer set. Checked live over a
> multi-row query: `RETURNING jsonb` and `json` stick, while `integer`,
> `text`, an array, a composite and a domain over `jsonb` (converted by a
> step that clears the flag) do not, and nor does a `JSON_TABLE` column of
> type `jsonb`, which is read as `JSON_QUERY` reads it. No rewrite answers the
> same: `JSON_QUERY` returns a JSON `null` as itself and an object or array
> rather than failing, so a caller wanting JSON out of a path reaches for it
> knowing those two differences, and a `Named` type is the caller's own
> spelling, not inspected. A test pins the defect, so the release that fixes
> it is noticed and the two variants return. The `FORMAT JSON [ENCODING UTF8]` a `RETURNING`
> may carry is not built: the output is UTF-8 JSON text either way, and a
> `bytea` result is the same bytes with or without it (live-checked);
> `JSON_VALUE` refuses it outright.
>
> **`ON NULL` and `UNIQUE KEYS`** each have the one spelling that differs from
> PostgreSQL's default, so each state has exactly one: an object keeps a
> `NULL` member unless `absent_on_null()`, an array drops a `NULL` element
> unless `null_on_null()`, and keys may repeat unless `with_unique_keys()`
> (then a repeat is `22030`). `JSON_OBJECT` and `JSON_OBJECTAGG` take the
> first and third, `JSON_ARRAY` and `JSON_ARRAYAGG` the second, `JSON()` and
> `IS JSON` only the third. The query form of `JSON_ARRAY` takes neither
> (`42601`) and always drops `NULL`s, so it is its own builder,
> `JsonArrayQuery`, with only `returning`; its query must have one column
> (`42601`), which the builder cannot see through `*`. Over a query of no
> rows it is the empty array from PostgreSQL 19, and `NULL` on 18, which
> answered it as the aggregate below does. An object's key may
> not be `NULL` (`22004`).
>
> **The aggregates** take `filter(cond)`, the `FILTER (WHERE ..)` of

> would fail on `bytea` (`42846`), which `JSON_SERIALIZE` takes, marked or not.
> `JSON(..)` is the conversion that fits every operand: live on 18.6 it turns

> `JSON_TABLE` is a FROM item, `FromItem::JsonTable(Box<JsonTable>, Name)`:
> rows read out of a JSON document, one per item its path finds, one column
> per column definition. `Func::json_table(context, path, column)` builds a
> `JsonTable` and takes its first column, because PostgreSQL refuses an empty
> list (`COLUMNS ()` is `42601`); `column(c)` appends more. `passing(value,
> name)` gives the paths a variable, bound, as it does for the query functions
> (`sql.ast.expr.sql-json`); `path_name(name)` names the root path (`AS name`);
> `on_error(b)` takes a `JsonTableBehavior` — `Error` or `Empty` — the only two
> PostgreSQL admits there (`NULL ON ERROR` is `42601`, "Only EMPTY [ ARRAY ] or
> ERROR is allowed in the top-level ON ERROR clause"); without one, a failing
> root path yields no rows, `EMPTY` spelled or not. `EMPTY ARRAY` is the same
> behaviour and is not a second spelling. `alias(name)` makes the `FromItem`.
> PostgreSQL would name an unaliased `JSON_TABLE` `json_table`, but the alias is
> required here as on every FROM item that is not a table
> (`sql.types.table-ref`), so its columns are qualified by a name the caller
> chose. Like a function in FROM, it is implicitly `LATERAL`: its context item
> may read the columns of the FROM items before it, whether it follows a comma
> or a join (`LEFT JOIN JSON_TABLE(..) ON TRUE` keeps a row whose document
> yields nothing).

> **Paths are literals here.** The root path is refused as a parameter
> (`0A000`, "only string constants are supported in JSON_TABLE path
> specification") and a column's or a nested path is a string constant in the
> grammar, a parameter being a syntax error (`42601`). Each is therefore a
> `String` the renderer writes through the value pipeline's literal escaping
> (`sql.render.json-table`), never interpolated; the `PASSING` values are
> still bound, so caller data that needs to reach a path goes through a

> **A column** is a `JsonTableColumn`, made by one of five constructors:
>
> - `ordinality(name)` — `name FOR ORDINALITY`, the row's number from 1.
> - `value(name, type)` — `name type`, a `JsonValueColumn`: the scalar its
>   path finds, read as `JSON_VALUE` reads it, with `on_empty` and `on_error`
>   taking a `JsonValueBehavior`. The server refuses `EMPTY ARRAY` or `EMPTY
>   OBJECT` on a scalar column (`42601`, "Only ERROR, NULL, or DEFAULT
>   expression is allowed in ON ERROR for scalar columns"), which the type
>   leaves out. A `json`, `jsonb`, array or composite type is read as
>   `JSON_QUERY` reads it, under the same three behaviours.
> - `query(name, type)` — `name type FORMAT JSON`, a `JsonQueryColumn`: the
>   JSON its path finds, read as `JSON_QUERY` reads it, with the shaping slot
>   (`with_wrapper`, `with_conditional_wrapper`, `omit_quotes`) and
>   `JsonQueryBehavior`s. `FORMAT JSON` is always written, which is what makes
>   the column `JSON_QUERY`'s whatever its type; the type must be a string
>   type, `json`, `jsonb` or `bytea` (`0A000`, "cannot use JSON format with
>   non-string output types", otherwise).
> - `exists(name, type)` — `name type EXISTS`, a `JsonExistsColumn`: whether
>   its path finds anything, as a `boolean`, an integer or text; `on_error`
>   takes a `JsonExistsBehavior` and there is no `ON EMPTY` (`42601`), as for
>   `JSON_EXISTS`.
> - `nested(path, column)` — `NESTED PATH path COLUMNS (..)`, a
>   `JsonNestedColumns` taking its first column for the same reason the table
>   does (`42601` for an empty one), with `column(c)` and `path_name(name)`.
>   A nested path's rows join their parent's as an outer join would: a parent
>   whose nested path finds nothing keeps one row, its nested columns `NULL`.
>
> Each of the first four takes `path(p)`; without one a column reads
> `$."name"` — its own name, matched exactly as written, since the name is
> quoted. Column names and path names share one namespace across the whole
> table, nested levels included, and a name given twice is refused (`42712`,
> "duplicate JSON_TABLE column or path name"); the builder does not track
> names, so that check is the server's. Column names, path names, the
> `PASSING` names and the alias are caller-supplied identifiers, quoted like
> every other and registered with the identifier oracle
> (`security.ident-oracle`). PostgreSQL 18's grammar has no `PLAN` clause
> (`42601`), so there is none to build.
