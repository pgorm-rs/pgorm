# Schema Generation from Entities

`src/schema/` projects compile-time entity definitions (`EntityTrait`) into
`pgorm_query` DDL statements. `Schema` is a stateless helper — `Schema::new()`
takes no backend argument because pgorm is PostgreSQL-only. The statements are
returned to the caller (typically migrations or test setup); nothing here
executes SQL.

## Table projection

> [spec:pgorm:sem:schema.from-entity+7]
> `Schema::create_table_from_entity::<E>()` produces one `TableCreateStatement`
> for `E`: the table ref from `entity.table_ref()`, the entity comment if any,
> and one column per `E::Column` variant projected from `ColumnTrait::def()` —
> the declared `ColumnType` (with `Enum { name, .. }` rewritten to a named
> type reference naming the Postgres enum), `NOT NULL` unless the column is
> nullable, plus the column's default — a
> `DEFAULT` expression, a `GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY` or a
> `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (<expr>) { STORED | VIRTUAL }` of the kind it declares,
> whichever its definition holds (`entity.traits.column-def`) — and its
> comment. A key is the table's (`sql.ddl.create-table`): the entity's
> primary key becomes the table's, and each `unique` column a one-column
> unique key, added in `E::Column` order.
>
> The primary key is `E::PrimaryKey`'s columns in order, at any arity. A
> one-column key is left unnamed, so PostgreSQL names it `{table}_pkey`, and
> its column is drawn from the serial family when
> `E::PrimaryKey::auto_increment()` is true and the column holds no default of
> its own: PostgreSQL refuses `serial` beside a `DEFAULT`, an identity or a
> generation expression (42601), and a key filled by any of them is generated
> already. A composite key
> (arity > 1) is named `pk-{table}`, and no column of it is drawn from the
> serial family whatever
> `auto_increment()` says: a composite key's generated column is the one whose
> definition holds an identity, rendered on that column alone, so
> `(tenant_id, id)` with `id` an identity builds a table whose inserts name
> `tenant_id` and get `id`. Foreign keys are generated from `E::Relation` entries
> whose `RelationDef` has `is_owner == false` (the belongs-to side); owner-side
> relations produce no constraint. A foreign key carries the full table name
> of both sides — schema qualification included, via `unpack_table_name` — so
> a `REFERENCES` clause names the table the relation points at rather than
> whatever `search_path` resolves; the derived constraint name still uses the
> bare table.
>
> Comments ride on the create statement (`get_comment()`,
> `ColumnSpec::Comment`) but are inert there — executing it attaches nothing
> (`[spec:pgorm:req:sql.ddl.create-table+8]`). They are a second statement
> stream instead: `Schema::create_comments_from_entity::<E>()` returns the
> `COMMENT ON` statements for the same entity — the entity comment first when
> `E::comment()` is set, then one per column whose `ColumnDef` carries a
> comment, in `E::Column` order — each targeting `entity.table_ref()`, so a
> comment lands on the same qualified name the table projection uses. The Vec
> is empty when no comment is declared. `table_ref()` is a `TableName`, which
> always names a table, so the comment target needs no conversion and the
> stream has no failure mode.

## Secondary indexes

> [spec:pgorm:sem:schema.from-entity.index+1]
> `Schema::create_index_from_entity::<E>()` returns one `IndexCreateStatement`
> per column whose `ColumnDef` has the `indexed` flag, named
> `idx-{table}-{column}` over that single column, and an empty `Vec` when no
> column is indexed. Each statement targets `entity.table_ref()`, the same ref
> the table projection uses, so the index is schema-qualified
> (`ON "{schema}"."{table}"`) exactly when the entity declares a
> `schema_name` and bare (`ON "{table}"`) when it does not. Unique columns are
> not covered here — uniqueness is emitted as a column-level unique key by the
> table projection, not as a separate index statement — and multi-column
> indexes cannot be expressed.

## Postgres enum types

> [spec:pgorm:sem:schema.from-entity.enum+3]
> `Schema::create_enum_from_entity::<E>()` scans `E::Column` and returns one
> `TypeCreateStatement` (`CREATE TYPE {name} AS ENUM ({variants})`) per enum
> its columns resolve to, preserving declared variant order; a column that
> resolves to no enum contributes no statement, so this form cannot fail. A
> column type resolves through one level of `ColumnType::Array`, so a column
> holding an array of a database enum names the enum the array is over: the
> table projection renders such a column as `{name}[]`, which no database can
> accept unless the element type exists, so an entity reaching an enum only
> through an array still carries the `CREATE TYPE` that makes its table
> creatable. The resolved enums are then deduplicated by type name across the
> entity's columns, first occurrence winning — two columns over one enum (a
> scalar and an array of it, say) yield one statement, because Postgres has no
> `CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS` and re-creating a type is an error rather than a
> no-op. Both halves match the generation path
> (`[spec:pgorm:sem:codegen.entity.transform+11]`), which registers an
> `ActiveEnum` for every column whose array-inner type is `ColumnType::Enum`,
> keyed by enum name.
> `Schema::create_enum_from_active_enum::<A>()` builds the same statement from
> `A::db_type()` for a single `ActiveEnum`, and returns `Error::Type` naming the
> enum if the resolved column type is not `ColumnType::Enum` — an `ActiveEnum`
> backed by a plain column type has no database enum to create.
