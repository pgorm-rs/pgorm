# Connections, Pooling, and Transactions

pgorm's connection layer is a thin composition over a vendored deadpool-postgres
fork (`pgorm-pool`) and `tokio-postgres`. `src/database/` exposes the pool and
connection handles plus the `ConnectionTrait` / `TransactionTrait` surface;
`pgorm-pool/src/` owns connection lifecycle, recycling, and statement caching.

## Pool construction and access

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool+3]
> `connect_with(config, tls, manager, build)` is the general pool constructor,
> and the only one: every other entry point delegates to it. It takes the
> `tokio_postgres::Config`, a TLS connector bounded exactly as
> `pgorm_pool::Manager::from_config` bounds its own (`T: MakeTlsConnect<Socket>
> + Clone + Sync + Send + 'static`, plus `Send + Sync` on `T::Stream` and
> `T::TlsConnect` and `Send` on the connect future), the whole `ManagerConfig`,
> and a `FnOnce(PoolBuilder) -> PoolBuilder`. It builds the `Manager` from the
> first three, applies `build` to the resulting `PoolBuilder`, and returns
> `Result<DatabasePool, Error>`.
>
> It exists because `DatabasePool` wraps a crate-private `pgorm_pool::Pool` and
> has no other constructor, which made two things unreachable rather than merely
> inconvenient. `Pool` is TLS-erased (`Box<dyn Connect>`), so a TLS pool was
> always buildable inside `pgorm-pool` and never assignable to a `DatabasePool`
> — leaving every managed PostgreSQL that requires TLS unusable through pgorm.
> And the `Manager` was fully built before any caller hook could run, so
> `RecyclingMethod::Verified`/`Clean`/`Custom` and
> `StatementCacheSize::Bounded`/`Disabled` had no reachable setter at all:
> `ManagerConfig` is private once the `Manager` holds it, and `PoolBuilder`
> reaches only the pool. There is deliberately no `From<pgorm_pool::Pool> for
> DatabasePool` beside it — construction stays funnelled through one function,
> so a `DatabasePool` always holds a pool pgorm shaped.
>
> `ManagerConfig`, `RecyclingMethod`, `StatementCacheSize` and `PoolBuilder`,
> together with `NoTls`, `Socket`, `MakeTlsConnect` and `TlsConnect`, MUST be
> re-exported from `pgorm`. Every one of them is named in `connect_with`'s
> signature or its bounds, and calling it should not require depending on
> `pgorm-pool` or `tokio-postgres` directly.
>
> `connect(config: tokio_postgres::Config) -> DatabasePool` MUST delegate to
> `connect_with` with `NoTls`, `RecyclingMethod::Fast`, no tag, the default
> `StatementCacheSize`, and an identity builder closure — leaving the default
> deadpool pool configuration. Its signature is infallible by design, not by
> omission: `config` shapes the `Manager` and no caller input reaches the pool
> builder, so the only way the build can fail is if pgorm's own defaults are
> invalid. That is an internal invariant and MUST panic.
>
> `connect_with_builder(config, build)` MUST delegate with that same `NoTls` and
> those same manager defaults, applying the caller's closure to the
> `PoolBuilder` before building, and MUST return `Result<DatabasePool, Error>`.
> Because the closure is caller input, a builder shaped into an unbuildable pool
> — deadpool rejects timeouts configured without a runtime — MUST surface as
> `Error::Custom` carrying the builder's message, never as a panic. That is the
> rule for every fallible entry point here: `connect_with` itself, and
> `connect_multi_with_builder` (`conn.pool.multi`), fail the same way.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.get+1]
> `DatabasePool::get()` asynchronously acquires a pooled connection and wraps
> it as `DatabaseConnection`; acquisition failure surfaces as
> `Error::Pool(pgorm_pool::PoolError)` via `From`. `DatabasePool::status()`
> returns the live `deadpool::Status` (size, available, waiting) and
> `DatabasePool::tag()` returns the pool's tag as `Arc<String>`. An untagged
> pool receives a generated default tag of the form `default-{n}` from a
> process-wide monotonic counter in `pgorm-pool`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool.no-conn-trait]
> `DatabasePool` MUST NOT implement `ConnectionTrait` (nor `Deref` to the inner
> pool). Executing a statement always requires explicitly acquiring a
> `DatabaseConnection` via `DatabasePool::get()` first. This is deliberate:
> implicitly checking out a fresh connection per statement hides pool churn and
> breaks transactional reasoning, so the pool-as-connection pattern inherited
> from SeaORM was removed.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.multi+2]
> `connect_multi_with_builder(config, builders)` builds one pool per entry of a
> `BTreeMap<String, builder-fn>`: each pool clones the shared
> `tokio_postgres::Config`, is tagged with its map key, and uses
> `RecyclingMethod::Fast`; the result is a
> `Result<BTreeMap<Arc<String>, DatabasePool>, Error>` keyed by tag. Every
> builder is caller input, so construction is fallible on the same terms as
> `connect_with_builder` (`conn.pool`): the first entry whose builder cannot
> produce a pool aborts the whole construction with `Error::Custom` and no map
> is returned. `DatabaseMultiPool` wraps the same map shape and offers
> `get(key) -> Option<DatabasePool>` (a cheap clone of the refcounted pool) and
> `status()` returning per-tag `deadpool::Status`.
>
> Selection is explicit by tag key only — there is no round-robin, load
> balancing, or fallback across pools. `DatabaseMultiPool` currently has no
> public constructor (its field is crate-private and
> `connect_multi_with_builder` returns the raw `BTreeMap` on success), so
> outside the crate it is effectively read-only API surface.

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool.config-forwarding]
> `pgorm_pool::Config` is the deserializable connection configuration — the
> shape `PG__HOST`, `PG__PASSWORD`, `PG__SSL_MODE` and their siblings land in.
> Every field it declares MUST reach the `tokio_postgres::Config` that
> `get_pg_config` builds, or else MUST NOT be declared. A field the struct
> accepts and the connection never sees is a setting the caller wrote and the
> database was never told about, and nothing anywhere reports the gap.
>
> Three fields were declared, given `From` conversions to their tokio-postgres
> counterparts, and then never applied: `target_session_attrs`,
> `channel_binding`, and `load_balance_hosts`. The conversions were dead code,
> and the settings were dropped in every spelling but one — a value embedded in
> `url` survived, because `tokio_postgres::Config::from_str` parses it — so the
> same setting was honoured or ignored depending on which way it was written.
>
> Two of the three lose more than configuration. `channel_binding: Require`
> dropped downgrades the connection to whatever binding the server will settle
> for, which is the opposite of what `Require` asks and is invisible.
> `target_session_attrs: ReadWrite` dropped lets a connection land on a hot
> standby, where the first write fails with SQLSTATE `25006` at run time — this
> setting exists precisely to move that failure to connect time.
>
> `ssl_mode` was already forwarded and stays so. The rule is over the whole
> struct, not over the three that happened to be missing.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.config-redaction]
> `Debug` on a pool configuration type MUST NOT reveal a credential.
> `pgorm_pool::Config` carries two. `password` is one, and the crate's own
> documentation tells the reader to fill it from `PG__PASSWORD`; `url` is the
> other, since a connection string's `userinfo` holds the same secret in a
> different spelling. A derived `Debug` printed both verbatim, so a single
> `tracing::info!(?cfg)` at startup put the database password in the logs.
>
> The impl is therefore hand-written. `password` prints as `_` when set and
> `None` when not — `tokio_postgres::Config`'s own redaction spelling, and the
> reason pgorm's `DatabasePool` Debug chain was already safe. `url` prints with
> its `userinfo` replaced by `_`, keeping the host, port, database and options
> after it: those are what make the value worth printing, and only the part
> before the `@` is secret. A `url` in libpq keyword/value form has no `@` to
> cut at, and its quoting is not worth re-implementing to find the boundary, so
> one that mentions `password` at all is withheld whole as `_`.
>
> `Serialize` is deliberately unchanged. Round-tripping the configuration is
> what it is for, and a serializer that dropped the password would emit a config
> that cannot connect; the two traits answer different questions, and only one
> of them answers into a log.

## Connection lifecycle in pgorm-pool

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.lifecycle+3]
> `Manager::create` connects via `tokio_postgres`, spawns the connection
> driver future onto a tokio task, and hands out a `ClientWrapper` owning the
> client, the task's `JoinHandle`, and a fresh per-connection
> `StatementCache`; the cache is registered with the manager's
> `StatementCaches` registry, current with every clear asked of it so far.
> Before it connects, the first `create` of a pool whose `ManagerConfig`
> names a `statement_cache_channel` starts that pool's statement-cache
> listener (`conn.pool.statement-cache.listen`), and dropping the `Manager`
> stops it. Dropping a `ClientWrapper` aborts its connection task.
> `Manager::recycle` rejects clients whose `is_closed()` is true; otherwise it
> clears the connection's statement cache if a clear has been asked for since
> the cache was last cleared (`conn.pool.statement-cache.clear`), then runs
> the recycling method's query, if any. `detach` unregisters the connection's
> statement cache.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.recycle]
> `RecyclingMethod` selects the health check run on reuse: `Fast` (the
> default, and what `connect` uses) performs no query — only the `is_closed()`
> check; `Verified` executes an empty `simple_query` round trip; `Clean` runs
> a `DISCARD ALL`-like statement sequence (`CLOSE ALL; SET SESSION
> AUTHORIZATION DEFAULT; RESET ALL; UNLISTEN *; SELECT
> pg_advisory_unlock_all(); DISCARD TEMP; DISCARD SEQUENCES;`) that
> intentionally omits `DEALLOCATE ALL`/`DISCARD PLANS` so cached prepared
> statements survive recycling; `Custom(sql)` runs caller-provided SQL.

> [spec:pgorm:sem:conn.pool.statement-cache+3]
> Each `ClientWrapper` carries an `Arc<StatementCache>` keyed by `(query text,
> parameter types)`. `prepare_cached` / `prepare_typed_cached` return the
> cached `tokio_postgres::Statement` on hit and prepare-then-insert on miss.
> `Transaction`s, nested transactions, and savepoints created through the
> wrapper share the owning client's cache. The manager-level `StatementCaches`
> holds weak references to every live cache and supports `clear()` and
> `remove(query, types)` across all pooled connections, at once and whether
> or not a connection is checked out, and `clear_before_reuse()`, which clears
> each cache before its connection is next lent
> (`conn.pool.statement-cache.clear`).
>
> The cache is on the ordinary execution path, not beside it, and it is the
> whole of that path: each of `ConnectionTrait`'s six statement methods
> resolves its SQL through the cache (`conn.pool.conn-trait`), with no
> unresolved alternative beside it, so one text is parsed once per connection
> rather than once per call. What still bypasses it is `tokio_postgres`'s own
> statement surface — `Client::query`, `Transaction::execute` and their
> siblings prepare an unnamed statement per call and consult nothing — which is
> what pgorm-pool's `Client` exposes by `Deref`, what its `Transaction`
> forwards, and what a caller reaching past `ConnectionTrait` gets.
>
> A cached statement outlives the call that prepared it. That is the point, and
> three things follow from it: the cache is capacity-bounded
> (`conn.pool.statement-cache.bound`), because the key space is not; a cached
> plan can be invalidated by DDL under it
> (`conn.pool.statement-cache.invalidate`); and DDL can change what a plan
> was built from without invalidating it, which a pool-wide clear answers
> (`conn.pool.statement-cache.clear`).

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool.statement-cache.bound+1]
> A `StatementCache` MUST be bounded. Its key space is the SQL text, and one
> logical query spreads across many texts — an `IN` list rendered with a
> placeholder per element is a different text at every arity, 25 of them for one
> measured query — while every entry is a live server-side prepared statement
> that `Fast` and `Clean` recycling both deliberately keep
> (`conn.pool.recycle`). Unbounded, the cache would hold statements the
> connection will never run again for as long as the connection lives.
>
> `ManagerConfig::statement_cache: StatementCacheSize` carries the bound, per
> connection: `Bounded(NonZeroUsize)`, defaulting to 256, or `Disabled`. There
> is deliberately no unbounded variant — that is the growth the type exists to
> stop, and a caller wanting an effectively unlimited cache says so with a large
> `Bounded` — and no zero bound, which would be `Disabled` spelled a second way.
> The default is an order of magnitude above the worst measured spread of a
> single query and keeps even a large pool's server-side statement count in the
> low thousands.
>
> Inserting into a full cache MUST evict an existing entry before inserting, and
> MUST NOT panic or refuse. The victim is whichever entry the map yields first,
> not the least recently used: recency would have to be written on every lookup,
> making the read lock a cache hit takes today an exclusive one, and the bound
> exists to stop growth rather than to maximise the hit rate. Re-inserting a key
> the cache already holds replaces it and evicts nothing.
>
> `Disabled` stores and looks up nothing, so `prepare_cached` is
> `prepare_typed` itself: every call parses its own statement and closes it when
> the last handle drops, which is the behaviour that predates the routing of
> `conn.pool.conn-trait`. It is the opt-out for a caller who would rather pay
> the parse than reason about a plan cached across DDL.
>
> Evicting a statement — like disabling the cache, and like recycling with SQL
> that deallocates — drops pgorm's last handle to it only once the caller has
> dropped the rows it produced, because a `tokio_postgres::Row` holds the

> happens, not when the entry leaves the map.
>
> pgorm's `connect`, `connect_with_builder` and `connect_multi_with_builder`
> (`conn.pool`, `conn.pool.multi`) always take the default. The knob is reached

> takes the whole `ManagerConfig`.

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool.statement-cache.invalidate+4]
> Reusing a prepared statement admits one failure that preparing afresh does
> not: PostgreSQL raises SQLSTATE `0A000` — *cached plan must not change result
> type* — when a statement's plan is revalidated and the result it would now

## Statement execution surface

> [spec:pgorm:def:conn.sql-text+2]
> `SqlText` answers `fn sql_text(&self) -> &str` for a statement, and is what

> statement is its SQL text, in whichever of the two spellings the caller holds
> it, and there is deliberately no third form.
>
> What the seal excludes is tokio-postgres's prepared `Statement`.
> `ToStatement`, which bounds tokio-postgres's own statement surface, admits
> `str`, `String` and `Statement` alike; but a `Statement` names a statement

> `26000`, *prepared statement does not exist*. Under a pool, which connection
> a call runs on is not the caller's to choose, so a bound that accepts a
> `Statement` is a bound that accepts a statement bound to a connection nobody

> diagnosing it (`[dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable]`), and costs
> nothing pgorm could have used: a `Statement` retains its server-side name,

> `prepare_typed_cached`, `transaction(&mut self)`, `batch_execute` —

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.pool.savepoint-name+3]
> `pgorm_pool::Transaction::savepoint(name)` MUST quote `name` as a

## Transactions

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.tx+3]
> A transaction MUST be opened only by running a closure inside one:
> `TransactionTrait::transaction(f)`, and on a `DatabaseConnection` the
> inherent `transaction_with(mode, f)` and `transaction_with_retry`
> (`conn.tx.closure`, `conn.tx.retry`). No public method returns a transaction
> handle, commits one or rolls one back. The closure is given
> `&mut DatabaseTransaction<'_>`, borrowing the parent exclusively, so no other
> statement can run on the connection while the transaction is open, and what
> the closure returns ends it. On a `DatabaseConnection` the transaction is
> `BEGIN` on the pooled client; on a `DatabaseTransaction` it is a nested
> transaction, which `tokio_postgres` implements as a savepoint. Both
> transaction levels share the connection's statement cache.
>
> `TransactionTrait` is sealed, and its handle is the receiver's kind:
> `DatabaseTransaction` on a connection or a transaction, the
> `InstrumentedTransaction` of `metric.layer.tx` on the metrics wrappers, each a
> `TransactionTrait` itself. Opening and ending a transaction are methods of
> crate-private traits that take a token no other crate can construct, so even
> code generic over `TransactionTrait`, which has those methods in reach
> through its bound, cannot call them. The handle type is declared on a trait
> of its own, apart from the one that opens it: a trait that declares a
> lifetime-generic type and returns it from `&mut self` must bound it by
> `Self: 't`, which a closure generic over every `'t` cannot satisfy for a
> parent that is itself borrowed. Opening is generic over the borrow alone,
> never in an implementation that relates the handle's lifetime to the
> borrow's: a spawned task's `Send` check erases every lifetime in the future
> it holds and needs each implementation it meets to hold for any of them.
>
> `DatabaseConnection::transaction_with(mode: TransactionMode, f)` is the
> configured counterpart, opening the transaction through `pgorm_pool`'s
> `TransactionBuilder`, which emits `START TRANSACTION` followed by the clauses
> the mode selects. `TransactionMode` MUST be a closed `Debug + Clone + Copy +
> Default` enum of exactly four variants, each one a combination PostgreSQL
> acts on:
>
> - `Default` — the `Default::default()` variant — appends no clause. The bare
>   `START TRANSACTION` inherits `default_transaction_isolation`,
>   `default_transaction_read_only`, and `default_transaction_deferrable`, so it
>   opens the same transaction `transaction` does.
> - `ReadWrite { isolation: Option<IsolationLevel> }` appends `ISOLATION LEVEL
>   <level>` when `isolation` is `Some`, then `READ WRITE`. That clause is
>   emitted unconditionally rather than elided as the usual server default, so
>   the mode overrides a session running under `SET
>   default_transaction_read_only = on` instead of inheriting it.
> - `ReadOnly { isolation: Option<IsolationLevel> }` appends `ISOLATION LEVEL
>   <level>` when `isolation` is `Some`, then `READ ONLY`. A write inside such a
>   transaction is rejected by the server with SQLSTATE `25006`
>   (`read_only_sql_transaction`).
> - `DeferrableSnapshot` appends `ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE, READ ONLY,
>   DEFERRABLE`, and takes no parameter. Opening it may block until the snapshot
>   is safe, after which the transaction cannot be aborted by a serialization
>   failure.
>
> `DeferrableSnapshot` MUST be the only shape that reaches `DEFERRABLE`, and it
> MUST carry the isolation level and access mode itself rather than accepting
> either from the caller. PostgreSQL honours `DEFERRABLE` only when the
> transaction is both `SERIALIZABLE` and `READ ONLY`; in every other
> combination the server parses the clause and ignores it. Deferrability as an
> independent flag would therefore be constructible, accepted, and a silent
> no-op — an invalid state the type MUST NOT be able to represent. For the same
> reason no variant offers `NOT DEFERRABLE`: it is the server default, and

>

>
> `transaction_with` is an inherent method on `DatabaseConnection`,

## COPY

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.copy+2]
> `CopyTrait` is COPY's data flow on a connection: `copy_in(&mut self,
> &CopyFromStatement<F>)` starts `COPY … FROM STDIN` and returns a
> `CopyInSink<'_>`, and `copy_out(&mut self, &CopyToStatement<F>)` starts `COPY
> … TO STDOUT` and returns a `CopyOutStream<'_>`, over the typed statements of
> `sql.ast.copy`. It MUST be implemented for `DatabaseConnection` and
> `DatabaseTransaction`, savepoints included, and for the metrics wrappers
> (`metric.layer.copy`). A COPY's rows travel as `CopyData` messages beside the
> statement, which no `ConnectionTrait` method sends or returns (`sql.scope`).
>
> The methods take only the typed statements. Text that is not a COPY would
> reach the driver's `copy_in` as a statement that runs to completion before
> the driver notices that no data flow opened — a `DELETE` passed to it would
> delete and then fail — so text is not accepted at all.
>
> Both MUST borrow the connection or transaction exclusively for as long as
> the sink or stream they return is alive. A COPY in progress holds the
> connection's request queue: a statement sent while a COPY FROM is open waits
> behind data the caller has not yet sent, and one sent while a COPY TO is
> unread waits behind data the caller has not yet read, so within one task
> either never completes; a transaction committed while its COPY is open waits
> the same way. The exclusive borrow makes each a compile error, and is why

## LISTEN and NOTIFY
## LISTEN and NOTIFY

> [spec:pgorm:req:conn.listen]
> A notification is delivered to the session that ran `LISTEN`, as an
> asynchronous message outside any statement's result, so no
> `ConnectionTrait` method returns one (`sql.scope`), and a pooled connection
> cannot receive one at all: pgorm-pool's task drives it and discards such
> messages (`conn.pool.lifecycle`), and the pool lends it to another caller
> once it is returned. A listener is therefore a connection of its own.
> `connect_listener(config, tls, capacity)` opens one with a
> `tokio_postgres::Config` and a TLS connector bounded as `connect_with`'s is
> (`conn.pool`), and `DatabasePool::listener(capacity)` opens one with the
> pool's configuration and connector through `pgorm_pool::Manager::connect_raw`,
> which connects as the pool does and hands back the connection's I/O half
> undriven, as a `RawConnection`. That connection is not taken from the pool,
> counts against no size, has no statement cache and is never recycled. Each
> returns a pair, a `Listener` and its `Notifications`.
>
> `Listener` is the connection's `LISTEN` set: `listen(channel)`,
> `unlisten(channel)` and `unlisten_all()`, each taking `&self` and sending
> `LISTEN`, `UNLISTEN` or `UNLISTEN *`. Cloning it is cheap and every clone
> changes the same set, so one task can listen while another reads. A channel
> MUST be sent as a quoted identifier, every `"` in it doubled and the whole
> wrapped in `"`, so that a name is exact: its case and punctuation are kept,
> `Jobs` and `jobs` are two channels, and the name is the text `pg_notify`
> takes. Neither statement takes a parameter, so this is the only form the
> name can travel in, and the quoting is total, as a savepoint name's is
> (`conn.pool.savepoint-name`). A name longer than 63 bytes MUST be refused
> with `ListenError::ChannelTooLong` before anything is sent: PostgreSQL
> truncates a longer identifier with only a notice and would listen on the
> truncated name, which nothing can send to, since `pg_notify` refuses a name
> that long (`22023`). An empty name is the server's refusal (`42601`).
>
> `Listener` MUST NOT implement `ConnectionTrait`. Notifications arrive on its
> connection whenever the server sends them; a statement there would wait
> behind them, and a transaction there would hold back their delivery until it
> ended. The metrics layer does not instrument it (`metric.layer`): it is none
> of the wrapped types, and what it sends is not a statement a caller wrote.
>
> `Notifications` implements `Stream<Item = Result<Notification, Error>>`,
> `Notification` being tokio-postgres's — the channel, the payload and the
> sending session's process id — re-exported from `pgorm`. A task spawned when
> the listener connects drives the connection and queues each notification as
> it arrives, so `listen` and `unlisten` complete whether or not the stream is
> read. The stream yields them in the order the server sent them, which is
> PostgreSQL's: across transactions in commit order, within one in sending
> order, with a notification that repeats an earlier one's channel and payload
> in the same transaction folded into it, and a rolled-back transaction's never
> sent. Once `listen` returns, a notification on the channel from a
> transaction that commits afterwards is delivered; once `unlisten` returns,
> none is, though one already received is still yielded. The stream holds the
> connection open while it lives, and dropping it closes the connection, after
> which every `Listener` method fails.
>
> The stream MUST end only after an error, and MUST NOT reconnect. A
> notification sent while no session listens reaches none, so a reconnection
> would hide a gap the caller has to know about, to re-read whatever the
> notifications were tracking. When the connection fails or is terminated —
> `pg_terminate_backend` ends it with SQLSTATE `57P01` — the stream yields every
> notification already received, then the `Error::Postgres` it failed with, and
> ends.
>
> The queue MUST be bounded by `capacity`, a `NonZeroUsize`
> (`Listener::DEFAULT_CAPACITY` is 1024). When `capacity` notifications are
> waiting unread and another arrives, the listener MUST close its connection,
> and the stream yields those waiting, then `ListenError::Overflow { capacity
> }`, and ends. Waiting for the reader instead would mean leaving the socket
> unread, which holds the listener's own `LISTEN` and `UNLISTEN` replies behind
> the unread notifications and stops its session consuming PostgreSQL's
> notification queue. That queue is shared by every database in the cluster,
> and once it fills every `NOTIFY` fails at commit; closing gives up the
> session's place in it at once.
>
> `notify(db, channel, payload)` sends a notification from any
> `ConnectionTrait` implementor as `SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)`, both values
> bound. `NOTIFY channel, 'payload'` takes no parameter, so its payload would
> have to be escaped into the statement, and each payload would be a statement
> text of its own in the bounded statement cache
> (`conn.pool.statement-cache.bound`); through `pg_notify` there is one text,
> prepared once per connection. Being a `ConnectionTrait` call, it runs inside
> a transaction when given one, delivering at commit, and through an
> instrumented connection or transaction it is reported as the `execute` it is
> (`metric.layer.delegate`). The bounds are the server's: a payload of 8000
> bytes or more, an empty channel and one longer than 63 bytes are each refused
> with SQLSTATE `22023`.
