//! Names for what a live test creates on a PostgreSQL server that other runs
//! share, and the sweep that reclaims what a crashed run left behind.
//!
//! Any number of runs may use one server at once: two checkouts, two runs of
//! one checkout, the Rust crates' suites and pgorm-napi's. Each database or
//! role a test creates is named for the process that created it,
//!
//! ```text
//! {label}_{seq}__{owner}_{pid}_{stamp}
//! ```
//!
//! - `label` is the name the test asked for, cut to fit PostgreSQL's 63-byte
//!   identifiers;
//! - `seq` counts the names this process has minted, so two labels cut to one
//!   prefix, or one label asked for twice, still name different objects;
//! - `owner` is eight hex digits hashing the host name and the user, the scope
//!   within which a process id means anything;
//! - `pid` is the creating process, in decimal;
//! - `stamp` is eight hex digits holding the Unix second at which the process
//!   minted its first name, which tells the creator from a later process that
//!   was given its pid.
//!
//! No run drops a database or role it did not create, with one exception: a
//! leftover whose creator is provably gone. That is a name with this run's
//! owner whose pid no process on this host holds, or holds for a process that
//! started after the stamp, and to which no session is connected. Every
//! question this host cannot answer counts as the creator still running.
//!
//! pgorm's and pgorm-migration's live tests take this crate as a
//! dev-dependency, and pgorm-napi's `tests/support.ts` mints and sweeps the
//! same names, so each suite can reclaim the others' leftovers.
