//! PostgreSQL's keyword categories, and the one decision they feed: whether a
//! name part a caller supplied may be written bare at a given position.
//!
//! A lowercase name folds to itself, so writing it bare or quoted names the
//! same object — unless the word is a keyword. PostgreSQL sorts its keywords
//! into four categories (`src/include/parser/kwlist.h`), and the grammar
//! accepts each category bare in different productions:
//!
//! | Category | Bare as a column or schema (`ColId`) | Bare as a function or type (`type_function_name`) |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `UNRESERVED` | yes | yes |
//! | `COL_NAME` | yes | no — but some are the grammar's own type spellings or call forms |
//! | `TYPE_FUNC_NAME` | no | yes |
//! | `RESERVED` | no | no |
//!
//! A keyword the production does not accept is a syntax error at best, and at
//! worst a different statement: `not(1)` is a boolean NOT, `row(1)` a row
//! constructor, `distinct(1)` in first position a `SELECT DISTINCT`.
//! PostgreSQL's own `quote_ident()` therefore quotes every keyword that is not
//! `UNRESERVED`, and so does [`bare`], with two exceptions, each at one
//! position, where the bare keyword is what the caller means: the grammar's
//! type spellings in a type ([`TYPE_SPELLINGS`]) and its call forms in a
//! function call ([`CALL_FORMS`]).

/// A keyword category other than `UNRESERVED`, which the policy never needs
/// to distinguish from an ordinary name.
