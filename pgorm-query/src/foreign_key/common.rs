/// Specification of a foreign key
///
/// A foreign key maps columns of one table onto columns of another, so both
/// tables and at least one `(column, referenced column)` pair are taken by
/// [`TableForeignKey::new`]: PostgreSQL rejects `ALTER TABLE  ADD FOREIGN KEY`,
/// `REFERENCES  ()`, `FOREIGN KEY ()` and `REFERENCES "t" ()` alike, so none of
/// the four has a field to be left unset in
/// (`[dec:pgorm:invalid-states-unrepresentable]`).
///
/// The two column lists are one list of pairs rather than two lists, so the
/// referencing and referenced sides cannot disagree in length — a mismatch the
/// grammar accepts and parse analysis rejects, and so one no parser oracle can
/// catch. Further pairs are appended with [`TableForeignKey::col`], and a
/// temporal key's `PERIOD` pair, which closes both lists, is set with
/// [`TableForeignKey::period`].
